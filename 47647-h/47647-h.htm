<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>Upon a beautiful day in July, 1492, two brown-skinned
Spaniards lay upon the wharf that jutted far
out into the waters of the blue Mediterranean Ocean
at Palos, Spain, and looked meditatively in the direction
of the far West. From their dress it could be easily
seen that they were sailors, and from their conversation
it was only too evident that they were speculating upon
questions that then stirred the thoughts of many intelligent
seafarers.</p>

<p>"As you watch a ship, its hull first disappears upon
the horizon, then the spars, and then the masts, themselves,"
said one, "which leads me to the belief that
mayhap we shall&mdash;in some of our voyages&mdash;come to
a point where we shall fall from the centre of the earth
and disappear into the heat of a fiery furnace."</p>

<p>The other smiled. "I am of that opinion myself,"
he answered, "but I do not feel the same fear of toppling
off from the edge of things when I am on inland water,
for in the Caspian Sea I have found that there is an
end to all water courses and bodies of water that are of
smaller size than that before us. In maps, I see that
gnomes, dragons, hydras, and fire-breathing snakes are
pictured in the unexplored distances. Serpents of great
size and ferocity are supposed to live in the fiery caldron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>before us. Virgil, himself, speaks of them, and, as for
myself, I wish that I might have the opportunity of
seeing what is beyond the coast of Africa, which is the
farthest point that I have ever reached in some fifteen
years of wandering upon the ocean. 'Tis said that
Cathay, by some called China, lies beyond the horizon,
and is a land full of intelligent people ruled over by the
mighty Khan."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the first, "I think that your wish
to view the other world will soon be fulfilled, for rumor
has it that Christopher Columbus&mdash;whom some say is
half crazy with ideas that this world is round, and other
strange fancies&mdash;is soon going to be able to take a trip
across the sea, lying in front of us. Friends tell me that
he has, at last, obtained money and ships from the King
and Queen, and that he is about to venture forth in
search of Cathay. You must hurry, my friend, if you
would join his crew, for men tell me that the idea is
popular, and that many wish to take passage with
him."</p>

<p>The second seaman leaped to his feet. "I will go
at once and see if I cannot get a place," he said, and,
without more ado, he walked hastily to the narrow
street which led into the town.</p>

<p>Not many weeks later, three little caravels: The
Nina, The Pinta, and The Santa Maria, left their anchorage
in front of the quaint seaport of Palos, and, propelled
by a gentle breeze, made off towards the Straits
of Gibraltar. On board was Christopher Columbus:
dreamer, navigator, astronomer, mathematician, and
the first white man to leave a record of a trip to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>West Indies. The two Spaniards who had lain upon
the wharf of Palos were with him, and, with spirits
filled with the hope of new and strange adventures, the
steersmen guided the vessels towards the unknown
West.</p>

<p>Eventually the keen-eyed mariners sighted land, and,
thinking that they had arrived at India, the Spaniards
called the natives Indians, when they had reached
the shore and were surrounded by copper-colored
people. These savages were, at first, greatly afraid
of the fair-haired strangers and refused to meet them
on friendly terms, but, after they understood that the
voyageurs would not injure them, they began to barter
and trade in a friendly and intimate manner.</p>

<p>The natives wore no clothing and had their bodies
painted with grotesque designs, and in various colors.
They were armed with lances, tipped with beads of sharp
flint and fish bones, or hardened at the end by being
charred in a fire. Of iron and steel they apparently
had no knowledge, for one venturesome brave seized
one of the swords of the Spaniards and severely cut his
own hand with it, which proved conclusively that they
were not accustomed to this form of a weapon. With
cries of pleasure they received the glass beads, pieces
of lead, and other trinkets which Columbus and his
men gave to them, and, in return, offered the Spaniards
tame parrots, cavassa bread (of their own baking) and
long rolls of cotton yarn. But these presents did not
particularly interest the white adventurers, as they
were not only in search of a route to India, but also for
the shining and alluring particles of gold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>
<p>In their noses the Indians wore small, golden ornaments
which were of far greater interests to the greedy
invaders than were the tame parrots. So much so,
indeed, that Columbus and his men immediately made
inquiries regarding the source from which the natives
secured such treasure. They were told that these articles
came from the southwest, where lived a powerful
Monarch who was accustomed to have his meals served
upon dishes of fine, beaten gold. This stimulated the
spirits of the invaders to penetrate into the unknown
distance, for they were confident that they had reached
the outlying islands of Asia and were near a famous
deposit of riches of which other Spanish travellers had
written.</p>

<p>The daring Columbus had reached San Salvador&mdash;a
beautiful isle of the West Indies&mdash;which was surrounded
by other fertile islands, covered with palms and luxurious
foliage, from which came the chatter of parrots, the cries
of tropical birds of brilliant plumage, and the sweet
scent of flowers and of fruit. As the Indians were not
molested they became more friendly, and it was easier
to understand their signs and gesticulations. From
these the Spaniards learned that they were in the midst
of an archipelago&mdash;or collection of islands&mdash;and that
there were more than a hundred of these, inhabited by
people who were continually at war with one another&mdash;a
state of affairs that exactly tallied with what Columbus
had heard of the islands upon the coast of Asia. He was
therefore convinced that he was in a land which had
been previously explored by Spanish voyageurs, and
that he had found what he had set out from Spain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>to discover&mdash;a new and more direct route from the
mother country to the East Indies and the Chinese
Empire.</p>

<p>Columbus weighed anchor and kept sailing from one
island to another, hoping to find Cathay, or China.
But temples, palaces, and cities did not appear. In
their stead, frail houses of bark and of reeds, fields of
corn and of grain, and simple-minded natives, came to
the anxious visions of the explorers. The inhabitants
of these sweet-scented isles could tell them nothing of
the deposits of gold, or the palaces, for which Columbus
was searching, so, day after day, he kept on his way,
diligently scanning each new point of land, getting a
little gold, here and there, from the Indians, and also
some pearls, silver, and numerous skins of the beautiful
birds of the country.</p>

<p>Finally the Spaniards became discouraged with their
search for precious metals, and, after sailing to Cuba to
explore the coast line, their most trustworthy vessel was
wrecked by a sudden and unexpected gale. This did
not dismay the gallant Columbus, although a few of his
men lost heart, and, building a fortification of the wood
from the vessel, he left a garrison to defend it, provisioned
them for a year, while he began the long journey
back to Spain. With him went a few of the native
Indians, who were carried along to be shown to the
people of the mother country and to prove that a new
world had really been discovered, where dwelt another
race. They reached Spain in safety, and thus&mdash;for the
first time that has been recorded&mdash;an Indian from
America was seen on the Continent of Europe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1502 Sebastian Cabot, an English adventurer,
captured three natives on the coast of Newfoundland,
who were clothed in the skins of the beaver and the
otter, and who subsisted upon raw flesh. These he took
with him to England, presented them to King Henry
the Seventh and to the members of his court, and,
although they, at first, talked in a strange and uncouth
tongue, they soon learned the language of their captors
and discarded their native dress for that of the "palefaces."
They were the first Indians ever seen in England,
and what eventually became of them is not known.
Their picturesque appearance created a great impression
upon those who saw them and stimulated many a person
of adventuresome temperament to sail towards America
in search of fortune and of fame.</p>

<p>But the Spaniards and the Englishmen were not the
only seafarers who were sufficiently brave and adventurous
to cross the Atlantic in search of the unknown.
In 1508 the French discovered the mouth of
the Saint Lawrence&mdash;that mighty, Canadian watercourse&mdash;and
several natives were seized and transported to
France by the captain of the expedition, Thomas Aubert.
A few years later&mdash;in 1524&mdash;John Verazzini (an Italian,
sailing under the French flag), sailed along the coast
and anchored in several places before he touched upon
the Connecticut Coast, where twenty of his men went
ashore in a small boat and walked about two miles
into the interior. They saw a number of Indians who
seemed terrified and fled before their advance, but
they were anxious to transport some of the inhabitants
to France, so captured an old woman who had hidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>herself in some tall grass, with a child upon her back,
and two little boys by her side. A young girl of about
eighteen years of age was also near by, but when the
sailors attempted to seize her she uttered such loud
and piercing shrieks that they decided to leave her alone.
The old woman also set up an awful wailing when they
endeavored to carry her aboard their vessel, so they contented
themselves with taking a small boy to their ship,
who was carried to far distant France. America was
called New France by Verazzini, who returned for further
exploration, a short time afterwards, only to be killed&mdash;and
some say eaten&mdash;by the Indians.</p>

<p>When Captain Hendrik Hudson&mdash;a hardy English
adventurer&mdash;discovered and sailed up the river which
bears his name in New York State, in the year 1609,
he met various bands of Indians, both upon the waters
of the mighty stream and on the shore. These, at first,
were inclined to be friendly, but as his men treated them
with distrust, and would not greet them in a hospitable
and intimate manner, there were soon skirmishes with
the hostiles. On September 8th, the savages came on
board the vessel and brought tobacco and Indian corn
to exchange for knives and beads. They offered no
violence to the sailors for these were continually on
their guard, expecting an attack. The ship's log gives
an excellent account of what now occurred.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">September 9th.</span></p>

<p>"In the morning two great canoes came on board,
full of men, one armed with bows and arrows. Another
pretended to buy knives in order to betray us, but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>perceived the intention of the red devils. So we took
two of them to keep them as hostages. We put red
coats on them and would not let the others come any
where near us. Soon afterwards the canoes left us.
Immediately two other natives came on board of us,
one we took, and let the other go, but he soon escaped by
jumping overboard."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">September 11th.</span></p>

<p>"The ship had now anchored at a considerable
distance up the river. The people of the country came
on board, making a great show of love, and gave us
tobacco and Indian wheat."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">September 12th.</span></p>

<p>"This morning there came eight and twenty canoes
full of men, women, and children to betray us, but we
saw their intent and suffered none of them to come
aboard. They have great tobacco pipes of yellow
copper, and pots of earth to dress their meat in."</p>

<p>That the savages came to "betray them" was no
doubt a mistaken idea of the gallant adventurers, as
Indians rarely go upon the warpath with their women
and children, but leave them at home, where they are
out of danger.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">September 15th.</span></p>

<p>"Hudson sailed twenty leagues (miles) further up
the stream, passing by high mountains. This morning
the two captive savages got out of a port-hole of the
ship and made their escape."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">September 18th.</span></p>

<p>"The Master's Mate went on shore with an old
Indian&mdash;a Sachem of the country&mdash;who took him to
his house and treated him kindly."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">October 1st.</span></p>

<p>"The ship having fallen down the river seven
miles below the mountains (probably the site of the
West Point Military Academy) came to anchor, while
one man in a canoe kept hanging under the stern and
would not be driven off. He soon contrived to climb
up by the rudder and got into the cabin window which
had been left open, and from which he stole a pillow,
two shirts, and two breastplates. The Mate shot him
in the chest and killed him. Many others were in canoes
around the ship who immediately fled, and some jumped
overboard. A boat manned from the ship, pursued
them, and, coming up with one in the water, the Indian
laid hold of the side of the boat and endeavored to over-set
it, at which one in the boat cut off his hands with a
sword and he was drowned."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">October 2nd.</span></p>

<p>"The ship fell down seven miles farther and came
to anchor again. Then came one of the savages that
swam away from us when we were up the river, with
many others, thinking that he could betray us, but we
suffered none of them to enter our ship. Whereupon
two canoes full of men with their bows and arrows shot
at us after our stern, in recompense whereof we discharged
six muskets and killed two or three of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>Then above a hundred of them came to a point to shoot
at us. Then I shot a musket at them and killed two of
them, whereupon the rest fled into the woods. Yet
they manned another canoe with nine or ten men,
which came to meet us, so I shot a ball also at it, and
shot it through, and killed one of them. Then our
men, with their muskets, killed three or four more of
them."</p>

<p>This ends the record of Hudson's skirmishes with
the Indians, and, as he sailed away from the newly
discovered territory, he called the river Manna-hata, a
name which appeared in all the early maps of this
district, but which was subsequently changed to Hudson
in commemoration and glorification of its discoverer.</p>

<p>Although the sturdy Hudson had not taken any of
the natives home with him, still earlier&mdash;in 1535&mdash;the
French voyageur, Jacques Cartier, met a famous chief
called Donacona upon the St. Croix River in Wisconsin,
and was treated in a hospitable and most kindly manner
by him. But the white adventurer was anxious to exhibit
the savage in France, so, partly by stratagem, and
partly by force, he carried him back in his ship to his
own country, where the wild chieftain died soon afterwards
of an illness brought on by homesickness.</p>

<p>So runs the record of these early attempts of the
Europeans to take the Indians to their own land and allow
their own people to see what strange folk inhabited
this new-found country. Many then wondered from
whence these copper-colored natives had come and many
have since speculated upon their probable origin. It
is difficult to say where they really had their source.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>Some are of the opinion that they were descended from
Asiatic people who crossed to the Alaskan coast, in
boats, and gradually made their way south, to populate
the entire country now known as the United States.
In Ohio and Illinois there are vast piles of earth built
by human hands, hundreds of years ago. These mounds
are in various shapes and forms; some are of circular
build; some round; some square; others thrown up to
resemble birds, wolves, and buffalo. There are ten
thousand such mounds in Ohio, and near the city of
St. Louis is a single mound which covers eight acres.
The people who constructed these are known as the
Mound Builders, and it is believed by some that they
were a different race of people than the Indians whom
Columbus met with on his expedition to San Salvador.
By others, it is maintained that they were of the same
blood, and when the early discoverers of America were
searching the seacoast for gold, pearls, and a passage
to China, the Mound Builders were constructing these
curious cairns in many portions of the Middle West.</p>

<p>Many hundreds of mounds have been carefully
opened by archaeologists&mdash;or students of ancient
people&mdash;and their contents have been scrutinized in
order to discover what degree of civilization these
Mound Builders possessed. It has been found that,
although the Mound Builders were familiar with the use
of copper for ornaments and tools, they hammered it
from the native ore, and knew nothing whatever of
smelting or of casting. Their weapons and instruments
were mainly of quartz, slate, and of bone. Many carved
pipes have been found in their works, and it is apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>that they cultivated tobacco, maize, or corn, and some
other vegetables. Their pottery was similar to that
of the Mexican Indians&mdash;although inferior to it&mdash;and
the most artistic examples of it are certain small figures
representing animal and human forms, which have been
found broken and thrown upon funeral pyres beneath
the sepulchral mounds. Besides the copper&mdash;which
came from mines in Lake Superior, still operated for
this treasure&mdash;the excavations showed that the Mound
Builders used an abundance of mica, brought from the
mountains of North Carolina, pearls from the Tennessee
River, shells from the Gulf of Mexico, and obsidian
from the region of the Yellowstone Park in Wyoming.
It is, therefore, apparent that they had extensive commercial
relations with other people who resided near by.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Damariscotta River in Maine are
remarkable heaps of shells which rise, in some places,
to the height of twenty-five feet, and consist almost
entirely of huge oyster shells of from ten to fifteen inches
in length. Fragments of pottery and bones of moose
and of deer are also found in these curious heaps, and,
at the bottom of one of the highest, has been discovered
the remains of an ancient fireplace filled with human
bones and pottery. Curiously enough, similar banks of
shells are found in the St. John's River in Florida, at
Grand Lake, on the lower Mississippi, and at San Pablo,
Berkeley, and Alameda, in the Bay of San Francisco.
Here oysters still exist, but in Maine they are found in
such small numbers that it is no object to gather them.
These mounds could only have been constructed by
human hands, and, therefore, the belief is current that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>people of no mean order of intelligence inhabited America
long before the coming of the first white men.</p>

<p>Whether the Mound Builders and shell-heap constructors
were ancestors of the red men, it is difficult to
say, at any rate the natives with whom the white race
were soon to struggle for the possession of the Continent
of North America were savage, cruel, vindictive and
slothful. They could not adopt the ways of the white
man. They could not learn to live by the plough instead
of the hunting rifle; they could never see that
houses were better to live in than frail wigwams in the
forest, and so, in the end, the superior intelligence of
the white man triumphed, the Indian was forced into
reservations set apart for him and his race, and the
country was populated by men of European descent.</p>

<p>In the long struggle for the possession of the land,
several chiefs arose whose qualities of mind were superior
to that of many of their contemporaries. The names of
some of these stand out brightly upon the pages of history,
and the records of their deeds and daring show that they
were Indians who possessed a bravery quite equal to
that of their enemies, even if their other qualities were
inferior. Let us, therefore, glance at their illustrious
names and learn what we can of their vain attempts to
stem the unwithstandable advance of the white race.</p>

<p class="center"><big><big><b><big><big>FAMOUS INDIAN CHIEFS</big></big></b></big></big><br /><br /></p>





<h2>POWHATAN: THE GREAT SACHEM
OF VIRGINIA</h2>


<p>In the year 1603 the white wings of an English
vessel were reflected in the blue waters of Chesapeake
Bay, Virginia, as some hardy voyageurs upon
the deck of the ungainly-looking craft took soundings
of the depth of the water, admired the broad expanse
of fertile country, and, after making expeditions into
the many coves and estuaries, sailed away again for
their native heath. Hidden by the overhanging branches
of the trees which grew near the gleaming ocean, some
suspicious natives watched the fair-skinned strangers
with awe and apprehension. They were followers of
Powhatan&mdash;Chief of the Indians of seacoast Virginia,
and one of the most remarkable warriors of history.
They had never before seen the features of a white man,
and, although rumors of these strange people who came
from far-distant lands had reached them from the
natives who lived to the south, these were the first palefaces
upon whom their eyes had ever rested. As the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>new, strange vision of a rakish hull and flapping canvas
disappeared upon the horizon, they turned to each
other, and said, with smiling countenances, "It is well,
they will not return."</p>

<p>These savages lived in villages that were on, or near,
the banks of the many rivers which here coursed slowly
to the Atlantic. Their wigwams were made of saplings
tied together and covered with reeds, bark, or mats
woven from native grasses. They were warmed by
means of a fire in the centre, the smoke from which
passed through a hole in the roof. Thus they were comfortable
in the coldest weather, but very smoky when
the wind was blowing with any speed. A mat was
hung across the doorway to keep off the drafts from
the exterior, and the floor was covered with tanned deer
hides, or with mats of considerable thickness. Sometimes
a collection of these cabins was surrounded by
palisades, ten or twelve feet in height, and thus a stout
resistance could be made to invading bands of hostile
Indians.</p>

<p>The dress of these natives was scanty enough, except
in the months of December, January, and February,
when the weather was really cold. Those of rank wore
a mantle of skin embroidered with beads, during the
warm months, and a fur covering in winter. Their
feet were enclosed in moccasins of deer hide, tanned by
a long and tedious process. The women wore a long
apron of deer skin and deerskin leggins, while the less
prosperous members of a tribe had little to clothe themselves
with but woven grasses and turkeys' feathers.
In summer the men discarded everything but a breech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>clout, while the women practically went without clothing.
Both sexes colored their heads and shoulders a
brilliant red, with a mixture of powdered puccoon-root
and oil, while the belles of a tribe added to this decoration
by tattooing their skins with figures of beasts and
of serpents. Besides this, they would punch three large
holes in each ear and from these would hang chains,
bracelets, and copper ornaments. Sometimes strings
of pearls would be suspended from their ears and wound
about their waists, while the warriors would often wear
small green and yellow snakes, which were alive, and
would be attached to their ears so that they could crawl
and wrap themselves around their necks.</p>

<p>A quantity of Indian corn, or maize, was grown by
these Indians, and this was their chief means of subsistence.
Corn bread was the staple food, although another
kind of bread was often made of wild oats mixed
with sunflower seed. Their meat consisted of fish,
deer, wild turkeys and other game; while grubs, locusts,
and snakes were also a portion of their bill-of-fare. From
dried hickory nuts, pounded in a stone basin, and mixed
with water, they made a drink called Pawcohicora,
which was much relished at feasts and banquets. They
lived a simple, peaceful life; fought little with the surrounding
tribes; and were noted for the great age which
they attained.</p>

<p>When called to battle the warriors went forth with
tomahawks, arrows, knives and war clubs. Their
tomahawks were made either of a deer's horn, or of a
long, sharpened stone set in a handle like a pickaxe.
Their knives were made, for the most part, of stone, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>sometimes shells and reeds were sharpened for this purpose.
A stone point was put on the end of their arrows
and they were winged with turkey feathers which were
fastened with a glue made from deers' horns. They
often carried bark shields into the fray, which were
woven together with thread, and to make these round
in shape, a file was used, which was fashioned from a
beaver's tooth set in a forked stick. War clubs were of
round stones, pointed at the ends, and held by a long
wooden handle, while bow strings were of deer hide and
sinews. Thread was made by the women from bark,
deer sinews, or from grass.</p>

<p>There were three nations in the country which extended
from the Atlantic seacoast to the Alleghenys,
and from the southern waters of the James River to the
Patuxent (now in the State of Maryland), and each nation
was a confederacy of larger and smaller tribes,
subdivided into towns, families, and clans. These were
the Mannahoaks, the Monocans, and the Powhatans;
the first two being highland, or mountain Indians who
lived on the banks of various small streams which course
through the hilly country between the falls of the rivers
which ran to the Atlantic and the Allegheny ridge.</p>

<p>The Powhatan nation comprised a much larger number
of tribes than the others and inhabited the lowland
nation of Virginia from North Carolina, on the south,
to the Patuxent on the north, occupying a territory
of approximately 8,000 square miles; there were about
2,400 warriors in all and about 8,000 women and children,
not a large number, by any means, for such a
great extent of territory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>Their great chief Powhatan had been a splendid
warrior in his younger days, and, although he was hereditary
chief of but eight tribes, through conquest his
dominions had expanded until they reached from the
James to the Potomac River, and included thirty or
forty tribes. He was called "King" or "Emperor,"
his principal warriors were lords of the Kingdom, his
wives were queens, his daughter was a princess.</p>

<p>He was a tall and well-proportioned man, and, when
the English settlers at Jamestown first saw him, was
nearly sixty years of age, sinewy, strong, his head somewhat
gray, with a thin beard, and a sour look on his
countenance. He lived sometimes at a village called
Powhatan, near where Richmond now stands, and
sometimes at We-ro-woco-moco, on the York River.</p>

<p>Pocahontas, Powhatan's favorite daughter, was born
about the year 1594 and was one of eleven girls and
twenty sons. We know nothing about any of his sons
except Nateguas, whom the English claimed to be the
handsomest, comeliest and boldest among all the savages.
Powhatan had many wives&mdash;exactly how many is
difficult to state&mdash;and when tired of one he would present
her to that one of his subjects whom he considered
to be the most deserving.</p>

<p>At each of the villages was a house built like a long
arbor for Powhatan's especial reception, and when he
visited one of his towns, a feast would already be spread
in this reception hall, so that he could immediately seat
himself, with his companions, and partake of what was
in store for him. Besides these he had a hunting lodge
in the wilderness called Orapax, and a mile from this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>deep in the woods, he had another arbor-like house,
where he kept furs, copper, pearls, and beads&mdash;treasures
which he was saving to be placed in his grave at
the time of his burial.</p>

<p>A large number of canoes, or "dug-outs" were also
a part of Powhatan's possessions, and of these he was
very proud. The boats were manufactured from trees
which were felled by fire and were hollowed out by
means of burning and scraping with shells and tomahawks.</p>

<p>Forty or fifty warriors were always in attendance on
this powerful monarch, as his body guard, while every
night four sentinels stood at the four quarters, or ends, of
his cabin and every half hour they would, in turn, utter
a shrill war whoop, made by placing the finger upon
the lips and halloing. If one should go to sleep, or fail
to answer the whoop of his companion, an older warrior
would soon issue from Powhatan's cabin and flail the
offender with a stout wooden cudgel.</p>

<p>The Indians seem to have had a sort of idea that there
was some superior spirit, God, or creator, who watched
over their actions, and they worshipped an idol, or
Okee, who represented, not a good spirit, but an evil one.
Numerous priests, or medicine men, were always to be
found in these Virginia tribes, and they were supposed
to cure the sick by means of divinations and conjurations
which were very noisy and grotesque. These
medicine men did not work, themselves, and lived a life
of indolent ease, but they were of great value, as the
savages dared not steal from one another, fearing that
these priests would reveal the theft by means of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>conjuries, and then bring the offender into such disrepute
that he would be driven out of the tribe. Their
Okee, or God, was kept in a temple fashioned from
boughs and branches, and it was surrounded with posts
on which hideous faces were carved from soft pine wood
and painted blue, white, and vermilion.</p>

<p>The Indian year was divided into five seasons&mdash;budding
time, roasting ear time, summer time, the fall of
the leaf, and the season of cold or winter. The savages
amused themselves with sham fights, or with dances,
and most hideous sounding noises, or war whoops, as
they charged forward and retreated backward, around
in a circle. Their musical instruments consisted of a
reed cut to form a pipe, a drum made of wood with
deer's skin stretched on the end, and rattles made of
gourds or pumpkins. These made a terrible noise,
which frightened more than delighted the first white
settlers. When they had a distinguished visitor, they
first spread a mat upon the ground for him to sit upon
and then sat opposite him upon another. Then all
present would join in a tremendous shouting to bid him
welcome, after which two or more of the chief men
would make an oration in which they testified their love
and admiration for the visitor. After this a meal would
be served and a pipe of peace would be passed around.</p>

<p>English adventurers had attempted to form a colony
at Roanoke Island, just off the Virginia Coast, but it
had been such a failure that the ardor of English
voyageurs had been dampened and little effort had been
made to gain a foothold in Virginia. But the Spaniards&mdash;their
great rivals and enemies&mdash;had made numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>successful explorations in the New World, so that the
pride of the Anglo-Saxons was piqued and their cupidity
was aroused by the wealth the Spanish gold-seekers
brought back to their own land. Thus, at the beginning
of the reign of James I, it was determined to send ships
and settlers to America, where they were to found a
colony, search for gold, and ship it, when discovered,
home to the mother country. There were several promoters
for this scheme; one was a London merchant
named Wingfield, another a clergyman named Hunt,
still another, Bartholomew Gosnold, who had made a
successful voyage to the coast of New England several
years earlier. The most important was Captain John
Smith, a gallant soldier-of-fortune, who had been in
numerous adventures of a startling nature; had made
many journeys in Europe; had been held captive by
the Saracens, and who was a lover of all that was hazardous
and full of danger. He was now twenty-eight years
of age, strong, vigorous, handsome and energetic.</p>

<p>While a slave in the Crimea Smith had an iron collar
fastened about his neck, was clothed in the skin of a
wild beast, and was beaten and kicked about like a dog,
until his life was nearly unbearable. But one day he
seized a flail for separating wheat from chaff, broke his
master's skull with it, and then put on his clothes and
fled to Poland. Here he was aided by friends until he
reached Morocco, where he joined an English man-of-war,
and, after a sanguinary sea battle, arrived in England
in time to aid the adventurers setting sail for the
shore of Virginia. They left Blackwall, and dropped
down to the Thames in December, 1606, with three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ships, one of which, the Discovery, was a mere sail boat
of but twenty tons, manned by an equal number of
staunch souls, sailing over unknown seas to unknown
lands.</p>

<p>It took them five full months to cross the Atlantic
to the shores of the New World, and jealousy, discord
and mutiny had played havoc with the spirits of the
crew by the time that land was sighted. The ships
loitered along, and at the Canary Isles and the West
Indies had remained so long that the provisions were
well nigh exhausted. At one time it was proposed to
hang the restless Captain John Smith to the yard-arm
because he railed at their delay and declared the majority
of the crew, "merely projecting, verbal and idle contemplators,"
who expected to find "feather beds and down
pillows, taverns, ale-houses in every breathing place,"
and not the "dissolute liberty that they had expected."
As luck would have it, a storm drove the vessels into
the mouth of the James River, Virginia, and past two
jutting promontories of land which they called Cape
Henry, after the Prince of Wales, and Cape Charles,
for the second son of the reigning English Monarch&mdash;afterwards
Charles I.</p>

<p>All were overjoyed to see the long-sought-for Continent.
A landing was made on Cape Charles by thirty
men, but they were suddenly attacked by five Indians,
who dangerously wounded two of the soldiers and drove
the rest back to the ships. In spite of this, the spirits
of the adventurers were mightily cheered by the sight
of the beautiful bay, encompassed by a fruitful and
delightful land, and covered with forests which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>magnificent with the blossoms of red wood and dog
wood. A place was soon selected for a settlement,
called Jamestown, which was on such low ground that
it was not considered wholesome by many, and thus a
famous debate ensued. Finally it was decided to here
build a blockhouse, and all turned to with some will to
erect the first habitation of white settlers among Powhatan's
people. Gosnold had strongly opposed the
selection of this place, while Captain John Smith had approved
of it, but the former's advice was correct, as the
current of the river has turned the peninsula of Jamestown
into an island, and now, only a ruined church
tower remains to mark the situation of the first colony
of Englishmen in the United States.</p>

<p>Although the whites fell to, with spirit and enthusiasm,
to build up their town, unfortunately most of them were
"gentlemen" and unaccustomed to any form of work
or sustained labor. There were ruined spendthrifts,
broken tradesmen, fortune-hunters, tipsters, and gamblers,
in excess of some real workmen in the shape of
four carpenters, one bricklayer, one blacksmith, and
one sailor. A barber also figured in the rolls, a tailor, a
drummer, and four half-grown boys. The majority
expected to find nuggets of gold lying around in profusion,
and not danger, disappointment, severe toil,
starvation, and malaria.</p>

<p>When upbraided by Captain John Smith for not showing
more enthusiasm in their labor, some said, "We did
not come here to work, but to explore and find gold."</p>

<p>"Then you shall not eat," answered the quick-tempered
Captain, "for the labor of a few industrious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>men shall not be utilized to support idle loiterers like
yourselves."</p>

<p>A number of these settlers were also most profane,
and so the Captain kept a daily account of every man's
oaths, and, as proper punishment, had a can of cold
water poured down an offender's sleeve for each foul
word. This had some effect, but Smith was well disgusted
with their lack of ability to do anything, and
wrote to the company in England who had furnished the
resources to the colony: "When you send again, I entreat
you to send thirty carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners,
fishermen, blacksmiths, or diggers-up of roots, who would
be better than a thousand of such as we have."</p>

<p>The Indians meanwhile had become aware of the purposes
of the whites to dispossess them of their territory,
so they turned treacherous, and, although they entered
into no open hostilities, began to skulk about the
fort. After bringing in presents of corn and venison,
they would often steal anything which they could safely
carry off. They showed by their looks and dispositions
that they were extremely jealous of the whites, and,
when exploring parties were sent into the interior, suddenly
attacked the fort with about two hundred braves.
These were driven away by means of the guns of the
ship, after an hour's fight, and after subjecting the defenders
of Jamestown to a loss of eleven men wounded
and one boy killed. The noise of the cannon really
frightened the attackers away, and for some days they
hung around the stockade, so that it was not safe to
venture beyond the range of the muskets, unless one
wished to be tomahawked by some lurking savage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>Powhatan had received word of the coming of the
whites through scouts and runners, and he was soon to
make the acquaintance of the hardiest and most enterprising
of them all, an acquaintance that was to mark the
turning point in his career of undisputed sovereign over
tide-water Virginia; for the adventurous and ambitious
spirit of Smith had prompted him to make several expeditions
both along the coast and into the interior of
this densely wooded country. A few months after the
settlement of Jamestown came a time of threatened
starvation, but the gallant Captain discovered the tribe
of Chickahominy Indians, and from them gained a large
store of corn which revived the fainting spirits of those
in the little fort upon the malarial peninsula.</p>

<p>In spite of this there were many who decried what
Smith had done and said that he should have gone to
the headwaters of the Chickahominy River and should
not have returned without discovering the source of this
stream. The idle and unruly in the colony complained
that he had accomplished very little, and not sufficient
to be applauded. Stung by their taunts, the spirited
Captain again set forth (in the winter of 1607-8) to
ascend the waters of the river. He took with him a
crew sufficient to manage a good-sized barge, to which
was attached a small "tender," or jolly-boat, which
could go over shoal water and into bays and coves along
the banks of the stream. With these he ascended the
Chickahominy as far as possible, and then, leaving the
barge in a broad cove where lurking Indians could not
steal it, he pushed still farther up the stream in the
tender, accompanied by two other white men and two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>friendly Indians. Those left behind were strictly urged
not to go ashore.</p>

<p>But the sound advice was ignored by the foolish
fellows in the barges, and, as soon as the bold Captain
was out of sight, they scrambled to land and proceeded
to explore the country. Their rashness came near being
the cause of their annihilation, as fully two hundred
and fifty Indians were lying in wait for them in the
thicket. Under the direction of Opechancanough&mdash;Sachem
of the Pamunkies and reputed brother of Powhatan&mdash;they
made a sudden rush for the white men,
but, although the attack was unexpected, they only succeeded
in capturing one George Cassen, whom they compelled
to tell them which way Smith had gone. After
securing this information, they put the unfortunate captive
to death in a cruel manner, and struck off through
the tangled undergrowth in pursuit of the adventurous
English colonizer.</p>

<p>The bold Captain had gone twenty miles up the river
to the source of the Chickahominy, and, after poling
through several marshes, had waded ashore with his
Indian guide, to secure some game with his musket for
supper. The two Englishmen who were with him had
hauled up their boat and were lying down to sleep near a
fire, when they were suddenly set upon by the Indians,
who shot them full of arrows and killed them. Then
the crafty braves spread through the woodland in search
of Captain Smith, whom they soon overtook and surrounded,
but the brave settler was not to be captured
without a struggle, so, when he perceived that it would
be useless for him to escape, he tied the young Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>who was with him to his arm (what happened to the other
friendly Indian who was with him is not known) and,
holding him in front of him as a shield, fired at the
enemy and soon had three of them dead. He wounded
so many others that they did not seem over-anxious to
approach him. Meanwhile the savages kept up a vigorous
fire with their bows and arrows; wounded the Captain
slightly in the thigh, and shot many shafts into his
clothes, but he still kept them off and walked in the direction
of the shore. As luck would have it, he suddenly
slipped and fell into the bed of a quagmire which he had
not noticed as he kept his eye upon the foe. Sinking in
the mud up to his armpits, and discovering at last that
he was becoming benumbed with cold, he threw away
his sword, musket, and pistol, and made signs that he
would surrender. The Indians soon approached, drew
him out, carried him to a fire, and carefully rubbed his
body until he was able to stand up, for the cold quagmire
had so benumbed him that he could not use his limbs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Englishman was devising some means
of escape, and asked to see the leader of the Indians.
Opechancanough was pointed out to him, and, with
quick presence of mind, Smith drew forth the only trinket
which he had with him, a round, ivory compass with a
double dial, and presented it to the Indian Chieftain
with a low and courteous bow. The savages all crowded
around with eager curiosity and were perfectly astonished
when they put forth their hands to touch the trembling
needle and could not do so. Smith, meanwhile, lectured
to them upon geography and astronomy, telling them
that the sun continually chased the moon around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>earth, that the earth and skies were round, and many
other stories which were then current and were, of
course, as wide of being the truth as were the Indians'
own ideas. However, the savages stood amazed with
admiration, and, although apparently pleased with what
the Captain had told them, made preparations to execute
him and tied him to a tree. As many as could
stand in range now took aim at him with their bows
and arrows. At this moment Opechancanough held up
the ivory compass as a signal for clemency, and the
Indians threw down their bows and arrows and gave
up all attempts to put an end to the brave Englishman.</p>

<p>Now, forming in Indian file, the prisoner was carried
to the village of Orapax by the savages, and, upon approaching
the town, they were met by all the women and
children, who stared at the white man in wonder and
amazement, for it was the first "paleface" that they
had ever seen. A war dance was next begun around the
terrified Captain, and the savages screeched, sang, and
yelled so wildly that the Englishman was sure that he
had fallen among demons. But this affair was soon
over, the Captain was taken into a long house, and here
was guarded by full forty Indians, while corn bread and
venison was brought to him that would have been
sufficient to have fed forty men. He was given a warm
mantle, as it was extremely cold, and each morning
three women presented him with three platters of fine
bread and more venison than ten men could eat. Thus
he spent his days quietly, his mind intent upon an escape
as soon as the proper opportunity should present itself.</p>

<p>The gallant Captain now astonished the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>greatly by writing a letter to Jamestown, for how anyone
could communicate to another by means of marks upon
a piece of paper was a marvel to the simple-minded
braves. He had torn a sheet from his memorandum
book and had written to the Colonists, informing them
that the Indians were contemplating an attack and giving
them instructions to terrify the bearers of the note
and to send him several articles. The Indians undertook
the journey, although it was in the bitter cold of an
unusual winter. When they neared Jamestown and saw
the soldiers come out from the stockade, as Smith said
that they would do, the fulfillment of his prophecy so
frightened them that they fled panic-stricken, but left
the note behind them on the ground. As night fell, they
crept stealthily to the spot where Captain Smith had
told them they would find an answer, and, there, indeed,
were the very articles which he had promised them they
would discover. The savages were surprised and awed by
this show of what they supposed to be divine fire, and,
giving up all idea of attacking Jamestown, led Smith
from village to village until, at length, he was carried
to We-ro-woco-moco, the residence of the great chief
Powhatan, situated on the Pamunkey (York) River, in
Gloucester county, about twenty-five miles below the
mouth of the stream and at this time the great chief's
favorite habitation. He afterwards retired to Orapax
as he did not desire a residence near the English.</p>

<p>After his arrival at the village, Smith was kept waiting
while more than two hundred warriors stood wondering
at him as if he were a monster, and until Powhatan
could make ready to receive him. After the old warrior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>had decked himself in his greatest bravery, the Englishman
was admitted to his presence, while the Indians
hailed his entrance with a tremendous shout. The
Emperor was proudly lying upon a bedstead a foot high,
raised upon ten or twelve mats. His neck was hung
with chains of pearls, and his body was covered with
raccoon skins. A woman sat at his head and another at
his feet, while, on each side, upon the ground, were
ranged his chief men, ten in rank, and behind them as
many young women, each having a chain of white
beads over her shoulders and with her head painted
red. The Queen of Appomattuck was appointed to
bring the Captain water in which to wash his hands,
while another brought a bunch of feathers, instead of a
towel, to dry them with. Many of Powhatan's retainers
had their hair decked with the white down of birds,
and none were without an ornament of some kind.</p>

<p>Two accounts of what now occurred were published
by Smith in London. In the first Pocahontas is not
mentioned; in the second, he tells a long story to the
effect that she saved his life. The first account was
written shortly after the gallant Captain returned to
England in the year following; the second, sixteen
years later, and after he had had time to reflect and to
color his narrative in proper contemplation and leisure.
Doubt has, therefore, been cast upon the second story,
but I shall give you them both and allow you to select
your own conclusion.</p>

<p>In the first narrative the Captain says that, "Powhatan
kindly welcomed me with good words and great
platters of sundry victuals, assuring me of his friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>and my liberty within four days. He promised to give
me corn, venison, or what I wanted to feed us. Hatchets
and copper we should make for him, and none were to
disturb us. This I promised to perform, and thus having,
with all the kindness he could devise, sought to content
me, he sent me home."</p>

<p>In the second account, the valiant Smith states that,
"Having feasted him (Smith) after the best barbarous
manner they could, a long consultation was held, but
the conclusion was, two great stones were brought before
Powhatan; then as many as could lay hands on
him dragged him to them and thereon laid his head,
and, being ready with the clubs to beat out his brains,
Pocahontas&mdash;the King's dearest daughter&mdash;when no
entreaty could prevail, got his head in her arms and laid
her own against his to save him from death; whereat
the Emperor was contented that he should live in order
to make him hatchets, and her, bells, beads, and copper,
for they thought him as well capable of all occupations
as themselves." This version has usually been accepted
by historians.</p>

<p>When Powhatan asked Smith why the English had
come, the keen-witted Captain was very careful to let
him know that they had not arrived to settle in the
country, but stated that there had been a fight with the
Spaniards and that the English had been forced to retreat
in their vessels; that finally adverse weather had
driven them ashore in Virginia, and here they were only
to remain until an opportunity presented itself for a safe
return. Smith was a ready talker, but there is no evidence
that Powhatan believed him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>Two days after the trial for his life, Powhatan had the
captive removed to one of his arbor-like dwellings in
the woods and there left him alone upon a skin in front
of the fire. The house was curtained off in the centre
with a thick mat, and soon a doleful noise came from
behind it, and Powhatan, disguised in a strange manner
and painted black, entered the room with two hundred
Indians, likewise painted with this color. After dancing
around the amused Captain for a while, Powhatan told
Smith that they were friends, and that he would presently
send him home, but that he must promise him that
after he arrived in Jamestown he would send him two
great guns and also a grindstone. In return for this he
was promised the country of Capahowosick, and he was
told that he would be considered Powhatan's son. The
Captain promised to deliver the requested supplies, and
consequently he was sent to Jamestown with twelve
guides, who delayed on the way, although the distance
was short, so that Smith feared every hour that he would
be put to death. But, at last, he was conducted to the
fort, where he treated the savage guides with great
hospitality, and gave to Rawhunt (a trusty servant of
Powhatan) two cannon carrying nine-pound shot,
and a mill-stone, to present to the chief. For their
benefit the Captain had the guns loaded with stones and
fired at some trees whose boughs were covered with
icicles. The crash and fall of stones and ice so frightened
the savages that they fled into the forest and it was
several hours before they could be induced to return.
At last, their spirits became reassured, presents of beads
and trinkets were given them for Powhatan and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>family, and they started back to the great chief, well
satisfied.</p>

<p>The conditions at Jamestown were appalling, for a
number of men were about to desert, seize the smallest
vessel, and make off for England. But Smith was equal
to the occasion, forced the mutineers to remain at home
at the mouth of a cannon, and, although he himself was
tried for the death of Robinson and Emry&mdash;the two men
who had been killed in the expedition up the Chickahominy&mdash;he
was set free by the intercession of Captain
Newport, who soon whipped the squabbling colonists
into some sort of order. Meanwhile their despairing
spirits were buoyed up by accounts of Powhatan's
bounty and treasure, while every four or five days little
Pocahontas with her attendants would cross the river
and come to the fort with provisions of bread and corn.
This was all that stood between the wrangling "gentlemen"
and starvation.</p>

<p>Powhatan, meanwhile, seems to have regarded the
English with no particular suspicion or hatred. When
Newport and Smith visited him during the winter, he
exerted himself to the utmost to give them a royal entertainment.
The Indians shouted with joy when next
they saw Smith; orations were addressed to him and
a bounteous repast of roasted corn, bread, and venison
was spread before the company. Powhatan, himself,
received the Englishmen, reclining upon a bed of mats,
dressed in a handsome fur robe, and leaning upon a
pillow embossed with brilliant embroidery of shells
and beads. The chief men of the village were assembled
before him and four or five hundred of the tribe stood on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>guard behind them. A proclamation was made to the
effect that upon pain of death no Indian should offer
any discourtesy to either of the whites, while Powhatan
renewed his acquaintance with Smith with much show
of apparent affection. An English boy, named Savage,
was given to the Indian Emperor at his request, and he
returned the favor by presenting to Captain Newport
an Indian youth called Nomontack, who was one of his
most trusted servants, and who was told to spy upon
all methods and customs of the English. Three or four
days were passed in feasting, dancing, and trading, in
which the old Sachem exhibited so much dignity and
discretion that his guests had a high admiration for his
talents. His shrewdness was well exhibited when
Newport endeavored to barter with him for some corn.</p>

<p>The English Captain had brought with him a number
of trinkets, glass beads, and pewter spoons which he
expected to trade very easily for corn, and, indeed, the
poorer Indians traded very readily with him. But they
dealt upon a very small scale as they had not much
to spare, so Newport became most anxious to drive a
trade with the Emperor, himself, and endeavored to
do so.</p>

<p>"Captain Newport," said Powhatan, "it is not agreeable
to my greatness to truck and peddle for trifles. I
am a great Werowance and I esteem you the same;
therefore lay all your trading commodities down together
and what I like I will take, and in return you shall receive
what I consider to be a fair value therefore."</p>

<p>As Newport could not speak the Indian tongue, this
was interpreted to him by Smith, who told him, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>same time, that he must be most careful in trading with
the crafty Indian, and should not be too free in his
dealings with him. But Newport was a vain fellow
and felt that he could easily hold his own with the
Emperor and gain any request that he might make, so
he placed all of his goods before Powhatan, who coolly
selected those which he liked most, and gave him, in
return, only a few bushels of corn when he had expected
to obtain twenty hogsheads. "At this rate," interposed
Captain Smith, "we might have purchased our
corn in Old Spain, but now let me see if I cannot traffic
with his excellency," and, so saying, he took out various
trinkets which he flashed before the eyes of the aged
Indian, in the light, so that they shone with an extraordinary
lustre.</p>

<p>Powhatan's eyes rested upon a string of blue beads,
and he became anxious to obtain them.</p>

<p>"These are such as only Kings and Nobles wear in our
country," said Smith, "and of immense value. For a
string of beads you must give me three hundred bushels
of corn."</p>

<p>"That I cannot do," answered Powhatan, "but so
desirous am I of having them that I will give you two
hundred bushels."</p>

<p>"For two hundred and fifty bushels you can have
them," answered Smith.</p>

<p>And so they haggled, until, in the end, the witty
Captain Smith obtained somewhere between two and
three hundred bushels of corn for a small and insignificant
string of beads. Shortly afterwards the cunning
Englishman made a similar trade with Opechancanough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>at Pamunkey, stating to him that these beads had in
them the color of the sky and that they were composed
of a most rare substance. This Indian likewise fell
before the lure of the Captain's plausible and ready
speech, and several hundred bushels of corn were secured
for a pound or two of these beads, which now grew into
such estimation among the Indians, far and near, that
none but the great Werowances and their wives and
children dared to be seen wearing them. They were considered
to be imperial symbols and of enormous value.</p>

<p>Although tricked in this transaction, Powhatan was
bright enough to see that the English possessed a vast
advantage over his own men whenever it came to a conflict,
for they had swords and muskets, whereas his
savage followers only possessed bows, spears, and arrows.
He knew that if he obtained possession of these he would
be able to place himself upon an equal footing with the
Colonists and would also be able to domineer over the
less fortunate Indian tribes of Virginia. Consequently
when he learned that Captain Newport was to leave for
England, he sent him twenty-five turkeys and requested,
in return, the favor of an equal number of swords.
Newport was sufficiently inconsiderate to furnish them
to him, but these were not enough for Powhatan, who,
soon afterwards, sent a number of turkeys to Smith.
The Captain was keen enough to see through the trick
of the old gentleman, and, although he thanked him for
his kindness with a courteous note, he sent no swords in
return. Powhatan was highly offended at this and told
his followers to steal the Englishmen's swords whenever
they could&mdash;an order which they began to obey with such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>good effect that Smith ordered every Indian caught
stealing to be tied, severely whipped, and kept captive.
The Emperor of the Virginia savages now saw that the
game was a desperate one and so sent Pocahontas into
Jamestown with various presents and kind speeches to
excuse himself for the injury done by his disorderly
warriors and to request that those who were captives
might be liberated. Smith took this under consideration
and finally granted the Emperor's request, "for
the sake of Pocahontas, his daughter," dispatching the
captured warriors back to Powhatan's village, where the
Indian counsellors were much offended at what they
considered to be the cruelty of the white man, and
adjured Powhatan to seek revenge. The Emperor
affected to be satisfied and would take no action.</p>

<p>Newport had sailed for England, and in September,
1608, arrived with a second supply for the colony and
a paper authorizing him to make an expedition of exploration
for gold among the Monocan Indians, who resided
in the Blue Ridge. For this a barge was brought
out from England which could be separated into five
parts and thus carried around the falls of the Potomac,
and thence convey the explorers (as was supposed in
England) to the South Sea. It had been decided by the
London company, in England, to crown Powhatan and
present him with a basin and ewer, a bedstead, bedding,
and various other costly novelties. Captain Smith
offered to carry them to Powhatan at We-ro-woco-moco
and to invite him to visit Jamestown, for Newport was
anxious to obtain a quantity of corn in order to feed his
followers in search for the South Sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>Starting for We-ro-woco-moco by boat, Smith landed,
and, with four companions, went through the woods
for about twelve miles, until he arrived at Powhatan's
village. He found that the renowned chief was absent,
but he soon returned and listened with great gravity
to the speech of the subtle Englishman, who not only
invited him to come to Newport, but also to join with
the whites in a campaign against the Monocans. To this
the King of the Powhatans replied:</p>

<p>"If your King has sent me presents, I also am a King
and this is my land. Here I will stay eight days to receive
these gifts. Your Father must come to me, not I
to him, nor yet to your fort. I will not bite at such a
treacherous bait. As for the Monocans, I can avenge
my own injuries. As for Atquanachuck, where you
say your brother was slain, it is a country away from
those parts you say it is, and as for salt water behind
the mountains, the stories which my people have told
you to this effect, are false." Whereupon he began
to draw the geography of these regions upon the ground
with a stick, and, after further talk, Smith returned to
Jamestown and told Newport to bring the presents to
We-ro-woco-moco.</p>

<p>The various gifts from King James were therefore sent
to the Indian village by water, while the Captain with
a guard of fifty men went by boat. The day following
the arrival of the whites was agreed upon for the coronation
and so the presents were brought ashore, the bed
and furniture were set up, and, in spite of his struggles,
the scarlet cloak and other apparel was put upon the
unwilling Powhatan. He feared, indeed, that it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>injure him, but his servant Namontack, who had been
to England with Newport, assured him that no harm
would come to him, and so he allowed the clothing to be
hung upon his body, although he absolutely refused to
kneel and receive the crown upon his head. Finally
the patience of the Englishmen became exhausted, one
leaned upon his shoulder so as to cause him to stoop a
little, and three more clung to him and pushed him
downward, while one had the crown in his hand. Suddenly
it was slapped on his head, a pistol shot rang out,
and, in token of the coronation, the soldiers discharged
their muskets in salute. Immediately Powhatan leaped
upright with an expression of terror and fear upon his
countenance, for he believed that an attack was to be
made upon him, but, seeing that all was well, he recovered
his usual composure, generously gave his old shoes
and deerskin mantle to Newport in acknowledgment
of appreciation for these presents, and, turning to him,
told him that he absolutely refused to lend him any of
his men, except Namontack, to go against the Monocans.
He was most courteous and civil, and presented Newport
with seven or eight bushels of corn ears in recognition of
his kindness and politeness.</p>

<p>Little was now heard of Powhatan, but it became
evident that he was not on friendly terms with the
English, as the neighboring tribes refused to keep up
their trade with those at Jamestown, some stating that
they had been so advised by the great Emperor.</p>

<p>This naturally made Smith very angry. At one
time he contemplated falling upon We-ro-woco-moco
by surprise and seizing all of the stores of corn which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>would find there, but, feeling that discretion was the
better part of valor, he restrained his wild intentions
and in December, 1608, accepted an invitation of Powhatan's
to visit him. The Emperor had asked him to
assist in building a house and requested him to bring a
grindstone, fifty swords, a few muskets, a cock and a hen,
and a quantity of beads and of copper. Forty-six
Colonists accompanied the bold Captain on this expedition,
and at the first stopping place, Werrasqueake,
the chief Sachem of the place, endeavored to dissuade
the Englishmen from continuing the trip. "Powhatan
will use you kindly, but he has sent for you only to cut
your throat," said he. "Trust him not and give him no
opportunity to seize your arms." In spite of this the
unhesitating Englishmen kept on, and when at length
they arrived at We-ro-woco-moco and asked for provisions,
they were promptly supplied with bread, venison
and turkeys, while the Emperor stated, with some
energy, that he and his people had very little corn,
though if the English would present him with forty
swords he felt that about forty baskets could be collected.
Smith found that Powhatan would take nothing but
guns and swords in exchange for provisions and that he
valued a basket of corn higher than a basket of copper,
and thus became quite angry when he saw how anxious
the savage was to secure possession of the arms of the
whites. "I will spare you what corn I can," said the
Emperor, "and that within two days, but, Captain
Smith, I have some doubts as to your object in this
visit. I am informed that you wish to conquer more
than to trade, and, at all events, you must know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
my people must be afraid to come near you with their
corn, as long as you are armed with such a retinue.
Lay aside your weapons, then. Here they are needless.
We are friends. All Powhatans."</p>

<p>"You mistake our intentions," said Smith. "We
come not to conquer, but to gain provisions."</p>

<p>"I am old, Captain Smith," answered the great
chief, "and I know well the difference between peace
and war. I wish to live quietly with you, and I wish
the same for my successors. Now the rumors which
reach me on all sides make me uneasy. What do you
expect to gain by destroying us who provide you with
food? And what can you get by war if we escape you
and hide our provisions in the woods? We are unarmed,
too, you see. Do you believe me such a fool as
not to prefer eating good meat, sleeping quietly at home,
laughing and making merry with you, having copper
and hatchets and anything else, as your friend, to
flying from you as your enemy, lying cold in the woods,
eating acorns and roots and being so hunted by you
meanwhile, that if but a twig break my men will cry out,
'There comes Captain Smith!' Let us be friends then.
Do not invade us with such an armed force. Lay aside
these arms!"</p>

<p>But Smith refused to accede to this request, for he
feared that he was about to be attacked by the followers
of Powhatan who were clustered about, and so gave
secret orders for hauling his boat ashore through the ice
and landing many of his men who were on board. In
the endeavor to detain Powhatan, he started a vigorous
conversation with the old Sachem. Appreciating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Smith's ruse, the witty warrior left two or three of his
women to talk with him while he left the house in which
they were very hurriedly, with all of his attendants.
Captain Smith now found himself completely surrounded
by Indians. Fearing an attack, he drew his sword,
and, brandishing it about his head, cut his way through
the crowd of savages, who, as soon as he fired his pistol,
fled in all directions.</p>

<p>In spite of this show of hostility upon the part of
Smith, the Indians again flocked around him, while
Powhatan sent a large and handsome bracelet by the
hand of one of his chief orators, who made a long speech,
full of complimentary remarks and excuses for their
conduct. The savages also furnished baskets for carrying
the corn, and offered to guard the Englishmen's firearms,
an offer which was of course declined, as Smith
feared they would steal these necessary possessions.
As the fall of the tide made it impossible for them to
continue their journey that night, the English knew
that they must remain where they were. It was true
that there was treachery afoot, for Pocahontas soon
came to Smith's quarters in the woods and told him that
her father Powhatan was collecting all of his men to make
an assault upon his force, unless the Indians who would
bring in the supper should themselves be able to kill him.</p>

<p>The Captain was consequently on his guard an hour
afterwards, when ten, strapping, big fellows came into
camp bearing great platters of venison and other victuals.
They asked the English to put out the matches of their
muskets, for the smoke of them was most annoying.
But Smith appreciated their ruse, made them taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
every dish that had been brought in, so that if there was
any poison inside it would first take hold of those who
brought it, and, telling them to inform Powhatan that
the English were all prepared for him whenever he
wished to start hostilities, he sent them back to the chief
of the most powerful tribe in Virginia. There was no
attack, so the English sailed away on their journey of
exploration, leaving behind them one Englishman to
kill game for Powhatan, and two or three Germans to
assist him in building a house.</p>

<p>Today, on a high hill near the spot where once stood
the town of We-ro-woco-moco, is a stone chimney called
"Powhatan's Chimney," and, according to tradition,
this is the chimney of the house which the German
artisans erected for the great Virginia Sachem.</p>

<p>The English pushed onward in search of corn, for they
were sorely in need of it for the colony at Jamestown,
and at length came to the lodges of Opechancanough,
king of the Pamunkies, and a younger brother of Powhatan.
From him Captain Smith secured a certain
amount of supplies, only after a severe personal scuffle.
Thus, after an absence of six weeks, the Colonists
reached Jamestown with a cargo of four hundred seventy-nine
bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of deer
suet, in exchange for which they had given but twenty-five
pounds of copper and fifty pounds of iron and
beads.</p>

<p>The Powhatans seemed also to be on fairly good
terms with the English and traded with them most
amicably until Smith departed for England. Then,
realizing that their most intelligent adversary had left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
they fell upon the six hundred settlers who remained
behind, with such success, that at the end of six months,
only sixty men, women, and children were alive at
Jamestown. These were almost reduced to starvation
and were living on roots, herbs, acorns, walnuts, berries
and an occasional fish, when supplied by two ships which
arrived at Jamestown early in 1613 with some food-stuffs
for the colony. But what they brought was insufficient
for the needs of the starving people, and so
Captain Argall, who commanded, sailed up the Potomac
to trade with the natives for corn. Powhatan was now
extremely hostile to the colony; his men had captured
and stolen many English arms and had secured a number
of white prisoners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pocahontas had left her father's home
and had gone to reside temporarily with the Potomacs&mdash;a
friendly tribe which had its hunting ground upon the
Potomac River. Contemporary historians differ as to
the reason for this; one account being that she had
gone there merely upon a visit among friends; another
that she had been sent by Powhatan to trade with them;
and still another that her father did not like her friendship
for the whites and so dispatched her there to get
her away from any possible intimacy with them. At
any rate when Captain Argall had been informed by
friendly Indians that Pocahontas was near by, a plan
for making peace with Powhatan immediately suggested
itself to his unscrupulous mind. He, therefore, sent for
one of the Indian chiefs and told him that if he did not
give Pocahontas into his hands they would no longer
be "brothers and friends." And when the Potomacs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
fearing war with Powhatan, seemed unwilling to do this,
Captain Argall assured them that he would take their
part if any war should occur.</p>

<p>But how could he secure the Indian maiden, for she
appeared to manifest no desire to go on board the
vessel? This was indeed a problem, and, after thinking
the matter over for some time, he decided that he
would make use of a little strategy in order to gain his
end. So he offered an old Indian, called Japazaws, the
irresistible bribe of a copper kettle, if he would bring
Pocahontas to the ship. This was too much for the old
Indian to withstand. With the aid of his wife, who
begged her husband to allow her to go aboard, he managed
to get Pocahontas to visit the anchored vessel, an
accomplishment which was effected by appealing to the
tender heart of the Indian girl, who was so moved to
pity when she saw Japazaws refuse to take his wife
aboard unless she had some female with her, that she
offered to accompany her to the English ship. The
old Indian and his wife were highly pleased at the success
of their stratagem; so much so, that all through
dinner they kept treading on the toes of Captain Argall
and laughing aloud. But after supper the Captain sent
Pocahontas to the gun room while he pretended to have
a private conversation with Japazaws. He soon recalled
the Indian Princess and told her that she must
remain with him and that she could not again see her
father, Powhatan, until she had effected a peace between
his noble sire and the English. Japazaws and his wife
immediately set up a great howling and crying, but
Pocahontas was exceedingly pensive and downcast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
She even shed a few tears as the old people who had betrayed
her were rowed to shore, happy, smiling, and
holding tightly their copper kettle and other trinkets
which the witty Captain had given them.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the English sent an Indian messenger
to Powhatan and informed him that his dear daughter
Pocahontas was a prisoner, and that, if he would send
home the Englishmen whom he had detained in slavery
with such arms and tools as his subjects had stolen, and
also a great quantity of corn, then his daughter would
be restored to him; otherwise she would be kept and
treated with kindness and consideration. Powhatan
loved his daughter dearly, but he apparently had still
greater love for the English weapons that he possessed,
for, although he replied that he would perform the
conditions laid down by the English so that he might
regain his daughter, he did not do so, and it was a very
long time before anything was heard of him.</p>

<p>After three months of silence seven Englishmen were
sent to the Governor of Jamestown, three muskets, a
broad-axe, a whip-saw, and a canoe full of corn, and,
accompanying them was a message to the effect that if
Pocahontas were returned, a large quantity of corn
would be dispatched to the Colonists. But this did not
entirely meet with the approval of Argall.</p>

<p>"Your daughter shall be well used, but we cannot
believe that the rest of our arms are either lost or stolen
from you, and, therefore, till you send them we will keep
Pocahontas with us," said he to the emissaries.</p>

<p>To this answer the sagacious Powhatan did not reply,
and it was a long time before anything was again heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of him. Finally, as he remained silent for such a length
of time, Sir Thomas Dale, with one hundred and fifty
men, embarked in the Colonists' vessels for a visit to
the Emperor. Pocahontas was taken along, and when
the party sailed up the York River, Powhatan was not
to be found, while those followers of his who did appear
received them with scornful threats, taunts, and open
hostility. The English replied with musket shots, and,
after a sharp fight, some of the Indian houses were burned
to the ground.</p>

<p>This angered Powhatan greatly, and when they asked
why it had been done, the English answered by asking
why they had shot at them with their arrows. To this
the savage replied that they had meant no harm, that
they were the white man's friends, and that the blame
lay upon some straggling savage. A peace was, therefore,
declared and messengers were sent to Powhatan in the
persons of Mrs. John Rolfe and Mrs. Sparks, who were
kindly received and hospitably entertained, but were not
admitted to the great Sachem's presence. Instead, his
brother Opechancanough saw them and promised to do
the best that he could to persuade Powhatan to negotiate
a treaty, and that "all might be well." This was slight
satisfaction indeed, but, as it was now April and time
to sow corn, the English were obliged to return to Jamestown.</p>

<p>Pocahontas went with them with great unwillingness
and not without tears. For a year she was a prisoner
at Jamestown, and, as her feelings had always been
warm for the white strangers, they treated her with
the greatest friendliness and kindness. She was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
about eighteen years of age, with an oval, pleasant,
interesting face, large black eyes and straight, black
hair. Mr. John Rolfe&mdash;a young Colonist of honesty
and purpose&mdash;took a great interest in her, and, in the
endeavor to convert her to Christianity, fell in love with
this sweet and simple Indian Princess. Pocahontas
adopted Christianity, and, when marriage was suggested
by good John Rolfe, readily accepted his proposal.
Powhatan, himself, seemed to be well pleased with the
match when informed of it, and within ten days of this
announcement an old Uncle of Pocahontas and two of
her brothers arrived at Jamestown as deputies from
Powhatan to witness the marriage of his daughter and
to show the amiability of the father. Pocahontas was
first baptized, was christened Rebbeca, and, as she was
a King's daughter, was known sometimes thereafter as
the Lady Rebbeca, sometimes as the Lady Pocahontas.
The ceremony took place about April the first, 1618.
In the little Colonial Church at Jamestown, with its
wide-open windows, the cedar pews, and its plainly
hewed pulpit, with a canoe-like front, the copper-hued
Princess was united in marriage to John Rolfe, while
Colonists and three Indians looked on in solemn but
cheerful silence, amid the scent of wild flowers, the
trilling of birds, and the soft wind-gusts from the river.</p>

<p>From now on friendly intercourse and trade was re-established
with Powhatan and his people. Thus the
marriage was of great import to the Colonists, for it
relieved them from worry and alarm. And in another
way, also, the marriage of this sweet Indian maiden
benefitted the colony, for the nearest neighbors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
English&mdash;the Chickahominys&mdash;were powerful, free from
the yoke of Powhatan, and had taken advantage of the
feud between the Colonists and the Great Sachem to
keep independent of both. Now they began to have
doubts of their own liberty, when the English were at
peace with Powhatan, so they sent a deputation to Sir
Thomas Dale, and concluded a treaty with him, to the
effect that they would furnish three hundred men in case
of a Spanish attack upon the Colony, bring a tribute of
corn at harvest time (for which they were to receive
payments in hatchets) and that each of the eight of
their chief men, who were to see to the performance of
this treaty, should have a red coat and a copper chain
with the picture of King James upon it, and be called
the King's noblemen.</p>

<p>The marriage of the good Pocahontas to John Rolfe
seems to have put an end to aggressive interference with
the Colonists on the part of Powhatan. From that
moment until his death, a few years later, Indian warfare
was at an end, and serious difficulty between the
white settlers and the savages did not again break out
until the reign of Opechancanough, King of Pamunkies,
and Powhatan's successor. The Indian tribes are
democracies and he who rules must acquire and sustain
his influence by his absolute ability and energy.
The head Sachem had to be brave, hardy, patient, indefatigable,
and had to show talents for controlling the
fortunes and commanding the respect of the community
which he governed. Powhatan had every requisite for
success, and Opechancanough, who succeeded him,
possessed the same characteristics. Numerous sons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the great chief could have stepped into his shoes, had
they had sufficient ability to do so.</p>

<p>Powhatan exacted implicit obedience from his subjects,
and, as an old writer says, "His will was law and
had to be obeyed." His followers esteemed him not
only as a king, but as half a God. What he commanded
they dare not disobey in the least. At his feet they
presented whatever he gave orders for, and, at the
least frown of his brow their great spirits trembled for
fear. He possessed great tact and diplomacy, and his
long and artful conversations with Captain Smith in
order to gain time; the promptness with which he refused
the proposal to march with the English against the
Monocans; and his refusal to listen to the proposal of
two German deserters who fled to him from Jamestown
with the offer of bringing Captain Smith to him
securely bound; shows him to have been a man of no
small honesty. To the Germans he replied that, "Men
who betrayed their captain would betray their emperor,"
and forthwith ordered the scoundrels to be
dispatched with war clubs.</p>

<p>It is on record that no acts of thieving or aggression
against the white settlers at Jamestown were done by
the Powhatans, until Smith, driven to use aggression
upon his own part because starvation stared him in
the face, intimidated the Indians by a show of armed
force, and made them give him boatloads of corn by
threatening an attack unless they delivered the much-needed
provisions. From then on the Indians became
more suspicious of the whites, more aggressive, and
more troublesome. There is no doubt that the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
hot-headed spirits would have openly attacked the
settlers on more than one occasion, had not Powhatan's
restraining voice held them in check. At the beginning
of the settlement at Jamestown the savages could have
put an end to every white man in Virginia had they so
wished and had Powhatan so ordered. But these
Indians met the whites peaceably, gave them, at first,
plenty of provisions, and not until they appreciated that
the men with "thundering-sticks" (muskets) had come
to remain among them and to gradually despoil them of
their land, did they show that resentment, vindictiveness,
or cruelty, which afterwards characterized their
actions toward the settlers. And, as has always occurred,
the red men gave way before the all-compelling
advance of the whites.</p>

<p>When Sir Thomas Dale, who had been governor of
Virginia for five years, left for England, he took with
him Pocahontas, John Rolfe&mdash;her husband&mdash;and Tomocomo,
one of Powhatan's chief men, who had been told
by the Emperor to count the people of England and give
him an exact idea of their strength. The Great Indian
Emperor had a strong suspicion, also, that England had
no corn or lumber, because great shiploads of both
these commodities continually left the James River for
the Mother Country, and so Tomocomo was requested
to observe whether or no the white men had trees or
grain fields. The vessel reached Plymouth on June 12th,
1616, and, on leaving the vessel, Tomocomo prepared a
long stick upon which he was to cut a notch whenever
he saw a man. He kept this up for a day and then said,
"Ugh! Ugh! Too many! Stick not long enough."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
He also saw that England was not lacking in either
lumber or grain fields.</p>

<p>The popular interest in Pocahontas was very great.
Persons followed her about for hours, and crowds attended
her every appearance. She was presented at
Court to King James Ist, and his Queen, and made a
most satisfactory impression; for all were charmed by
her kindness, simplicity, and sweetness of manner.
But the noise, confusion and smoke of London tired the
timid Indian girl, so she was moved to Brentford, where
Captain John Smith&mdash;who had returned to England
because of a wound&mdash;went to see her very often and
talked to her of Virginia, of Powhatan, and of the great
sweeping waters of the Chesapeake Bay. It could be
easily seen that the kind-hearted Princess was homesick.
After the birth of a son, whom they christened
Thomas Rolfe, she longed to return to her native land
and to once more see her people, her father, and the
waving cornfields of the Powhatans, the Potomacs
and the Pamunkies. So preparations were made for
her journey. She accompanied her husband to Gravesend
where a vessel was being fitted for Virginia, but,
catching a severe cold, she died on the very eve of her
departure, and at the early age of twenty-two. No one
showed more sorrow at her unexpected demise than did
the gallant Captain Smith whom she had saved, whose
followers she had often warned of impending danger,
and whose kind intervention in behalf of the starving
Colonists had, on many occasions, moved the fierce
distrust of Powhatan to compassion and to concessions
of the life-sustaining and much needed corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>One year later, in 1618, her father&mdash;the Great Powhatan&mdash;also
went to "the happy hunting grounds,"
as the Indian says of those who have departed to another
world. Peace reigned in Virginia; his own tribe was on
friendly terms with both the neighboring Indians and
with the white settlers, who were gradually taking possession
of plantations upon the James; his cornfields
were being well tilled; and his people were contented
and happy. As a warrior he undoubtedly had been of
superior mettle in his youth, for without this he could
never have arisen to the position which he held. As a
counsellor, director, and advisor of the destinies of his
people, the fact that he kept them contented, rich, and
prosperous, is sufficient tribute to his ability as a great
Sachem. His dealings with the English were not treacherous,
save where he expected aggression on the part
of the whites; and honesty, integrity and intellectuality
governed his words and public utterances. For
an Indian he was notable, and, had he been brought
up in the same civilization and refinement which surrounded
the white invaders of his territory, there
is no doubt that he would have been as much respected
by the first settlers at Jamestown as he was by his
own people, who gave full credit to the talents of any
man of superior ability. His self-command and chivalrous
courtesy were quite worthy of the best of Englishmen,
and thus his title to greatness is secure.</p>

<h2>OPECHANCANOUGH: THE SCOURGE OF VIRGINIA</h2>


<p>Sir George Yeardley, Governor of the Virginia
Colony in 1616, stood before the door of his
cabin at Jamestown, busily engaged in conversation
with a stout yeoman, who was clad in rough clothes,
with a breastplate upon his chest, and a round iron
helmet upon his head.</p>

<p>"We are in need of corn, Captain Brown," said he,
"and we must, as heretofore, collect it from the Indians."</p>

<p>"But they have refused to give it to us," answered
his military companion. "They are growing insolent
and disrespectful."</p>

<p>"Have you tried Opechancanough?"</p>

<p>"Yea, and he had put me off with smiles and grimaces."</p>

<p>"Have you tried the Chickahominies?"</p>

<p>"Yea, and they have refused, point blank, to aid us."</p>

<p>"Then we must collect it by force or we shall starve.
Therefore gather one hundred soldiers. We will march
upon them tomorrow, and if they will stand, we will give
them a right smart drubbing. At any rate, corn we
must have and corn we shall get."</p>

<p>Next morning a force of soldiers marched out from
the stockade and soon filled the many canoes, near by,
by means of which they were carried up the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
They were armed with long swords, muskets, and knives.
Their bullet pouches were well filled, their breastplates
were newly polished, and the sun gleamed from
their shining helmets and steel weapons. They laughed
and chatted gayly, for they knew that the affair could
have but one outcome, and that would be in their favor.</p>

<p>After a merry journey, the homes of the Chickahominies
were seen in the distance, and, forming for the
assault, the soldiers were soon beset by hundreds of
painted warriors, whose yelping and screeching sounded
wildly through the leafy thickets. "You dare not
come on," cried one of the braves who had learned to
speak English upon his visits to Jamestown, and as he
spoke he fired an arrow at the oncoming whites, which
struck one of the men full in the breastplate. "On,
on," shouted Sir George Yeardley. "Give these red
devils a lesson which they will not soon forget. Move
cautiously, my men, and do not charge among these
wild fellows until I give the signal." So, carefully and
steadily, the troops moved forward in regular alignment,
firing at intervals, and occasionally striking one of the
screeching, jumping Indians with a bullet. They soon
drove them beyond the village, seized enough corn to
satisfy their needs, and turning toward home, beat a
safe and slow retreat through the forest, being repeatedly
fired upon by the savages.</p>

<p>As they neared Jamestown, Opechancanough&mdash;the
younger brother of Powhatan&mdash;met them in the forest.
He had succeeded to the position of Chief Sachem which
his relative had held before him, and was apparently
upon as friendly terms with the whites as his honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
brother had been. With much show of warm friendship,
he approached the leader of this successful foraging
party, and, bending to the ground, said:</p>

<p>"You now have been fighting with the Chickahominies.
I see that you have gathered much corn. You
will need to make peace with them, now, or there will be
much fighting. Ugh! Ugh! Let me make peace with
these people for you. They are a great nation. They
can do you much harm. Let me see that the peace pipe
is smoked between you."</p>

<p>"Your suggestion is a good one," answered Yeardley.
"I shall think it over," and motioning for his men to
proceed, they were soon on their way to Jamestown.</p>

<p>Not many days after this, Opechancanough&mdash;with
Yeardley's consent&mdash;went to the Chickahominies to secure
a peace. He pretended that he had used great
pains and solicitation to secure this, and so impressed
this fact upon these Indians, that they proclaimed him
king of their nation, and flocked from all sides with
beads and copper presents to give to the new Sachem.
From this time on the brother of Powhatan was content
to be called the King of Chickahominy, and thus&mdash;of
their own free will&mdash;a brave and resolute people came
to be his subjects. For many years they had made a
successful resistance to all attacks of other Indian
tribes, and had frequently given the English a stout
fight.</p>

<p>Opechancanough saw that the whites were increasing
in Virginia in alarming proportions, and in his heart
began to smoulder a longing to drive them out of the
country of his forefathers. He was polite and civil to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the settlers whenever he saw them, and no one could tell
by talking to him that he meditated any attack upon
the Colonists, but he was brooding over the situation
at all times, and was determined that, when the time
was ripe, he would take upon himself the duty of expelling
the English from Virginian soil. No better
preparation for war could have been made on his part
than he effected when he secured the submission of the
Chickahominies to his rule. It has even been thought
that he, himself, stirred them up to open rebellion when
the English had demanded corn from them, so that his
own influence over them would be greater. For they
knew of his hostile feelings towards the whites, and
marvelled, when they appreciated that he could still be
on such friendly terms with them that he was admitted
to their councils.</p>

<p>In 1618 these Indians murdered several settlers, and
although Opechancanough was asked to give satisfaction,
he did not do so. He was requested to send in the
heads of the offenders as a proof that they had met the
fate which was due them, but although he promised to
acquiesce to this demand, the English waited for months,
and no word came from him. Thus a few of the more
cautious of the Colonists began to fear that trouble was
brewing with the politic, shrewd, and diplomatic King
of the Chickahominies.</p>

<p>These fears had no evidence of being well grounded,
from the actions of Opechancanough, for the artful
Chieftain gave the English no open cause of offense, or
any evidence of hostility. It is true that the white
men suspected treachery, for one of the Jamestown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Colonists writes, in 1620, "Now Opechancanough will
not come to treat with us which causes us to greatly
suspect his former promises that he is friendly to us and
to our interests." But this slight uneasiness was soon
forgotten, for when Sir Francis Wyatt succeeded Governor
Yeardley a few years later messengers were sent
to the Chief of the Chickahominies, and he received them
with kindness, expressed the hope that the new President
would have a pleasant time in Virginia, and renewed
his former league with the colony, with apparent
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"I am much pleased to hear that the English are inhabiting
this country," said he to one of the messengers,
"and I think it would be well if some of your white
families would settle among my people, and some of my
Indians should settle at Jamestown. I confess that
my own religion is not as perfect as that of you English,
and I shall be glad to be baptized into the Christian
faith. God loves you whites better than he does the
red men, and he has given you knowledge of guns which
spit fire, which we have never had. In proof of my love
for my white brothers I shall give you guides to show
you to rich mines far up the river, where you can get
precious metals to send to your Mother Country in
exchange for sheep, oxen, and provisions."</p>

<p>The English were naturally delighted with such talk,
and, without the least suspicion that this wily Sachem
was plotting murder in his heart, sent some of their
best men to him to be guided to the mines. While they
were away upon this expedition, Opechancanough
dispatched a few of his followers to the eastern shore of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the Chesapeake Bay to secure a quantity of poisonous
herbs which grew there and which he wished to use in
getting rid of the English. "We would know your feelings
towards these whites," said his ambassadors to the
red inhabitants of this country. "Are you friendly to
these English invaders, or would you care to see them
exterminated?"</p>

<p>"We are friendly. We need their trade. They do
not harm us, nor do we intend to harm them," answered
the spokesman of the Indians of the eastern shore.</p>

<p>"But they will soon take all the land which you have
inherited from your forefathers, and will drive you into
the sea. Come, join with us in exterminating these
white invaders."</p>

<p>"No, no. We will remain at peace," said the men of
the eastern shore, and so there was no hope of their aid
in the insurrection which Opechancanough was planning.
The storm was slowly gathering, and it was to soon burst
upon the unsuspecting settlers like the tempestuous current
of Niagara.</p>

<p>The white settlers had taken up plantations over a
vast area of land, and some of them had farms at a considerable
distance from the river, from each other, and
from the stockade at Jamestown. Here, in fancied
peace and seclusion, they tilled the soil, grew corn, wheat,
and tobacco, and began to prosper in the wilderness.
Their women and children were with them, the rough-hewn
barns were full of cows, horses, and sheep, while&mdash;piled
near their log houses&mdash;the ploughs and other imported
implements of agriculture showed that the
civilization of the whites was soon to bend the wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to its will, and make the virgin soil produce.
There was no suspicion of an Indian attack. The red
men loitered lazily about the cabins of the settlers,
played with the dogs, slept in the sun, and bartered a
few skins, which they had trapped, for grain and provisions.
Apparently there was no thought or idea of
violence. Opechancanough was friendly; his warriors
were busy with fishing and hunting; and peace breathed
its security over the soil of Virginia.</p>

<p>But the tempest of hatred and revenge, which had been
gathering since the death of Powhatan, was to now
break upon the devoted colony. Hiding his true intentions
behind an aspect of friendliness and kindness,
Opechancanough had made every preparation to exterminate
the Colonists from England. He had silently
passed the word to his warriors to make an attack upon
the settlements upon the twenty-second day of March,
1622, and so carefully was the secret kept that not a
word of the terrible news escaped to warn the defenseless
whites. The various tribes, who banded themselves
together for the attack, were stationed in the vicinity
of several places where an advance against the settlements
would be easy and swift. They were directed
by Opechancanough to march with all speed to these
stations&mdash;the day before the massacre&mdash;and, although
the braves had to walk for great distances through a
dense forest (guided only by the stars and moon), not a
single straggler deserted the ranks of the Indians, nor
did a single mistake occur. One by one&mdash;in single file&mdash;the
warriors silently passed through the Virginian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>thickets, and, halting at short distances from the settlements,
waited in the underbrush for the signal to
advance.</p>

<p>In the early gray of this March morning, a redskin
slipped silently through the wood from the clearing of a
planter. He arrived at length to where his allies were
crouching quietly in the shadows, and, raising his hand
aloft, he said: "Ugh! Ugh! The time is good. Strike
now!" Without further consultation, the long line of
painted warriors slipped out from the forest into the clearing,
rushed across the open space to the cabin of the
settler who had dared to penetrate thus far into the
wilderness, and soon a wild scream and savage warwhoop
showed what had been the fate of the inhabitants.
Flames soon burst from the roof&mdash;the log hut was
ablaze&mdash;and, with loud screeches of joy, the Indian
devils danced about the crumbling remains of the once
peaceful home.</p>

<p>The savages knew exactly where every Englishman
was to be found. Some entered the houses of their
white friends, saying that they wished to trade. Others
drew the owners out into the forest, telling them that
they had skins there, which they wished to barter with
them; and still others fell upon the Colonists as they were
ploughing or working in the fields. The whites were
totally unprepared and thoroughly surprised. Before
they could think, they were seized, struck down, and
murdered. In one short hour, and almost at the same
time, three hundred men, women, and children were thus
brutally dispatched, before they had an opportunity to
seize anything to defend themselves with. Wild screams
of terror went up in the wilderness, as the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
completed their butchery, and there were none there
who could aid the defenseless Colonists of Virginia.</p>

<p>But the Indians did not have an easy time with all the
whites whom they attacked. When they rushed in upon
Nathaniel Causie&mdash;an old soldier of Captain Smith's&mdash;he
seized an axe, and, although wounded by several
arrows, when a savage tried to stick a knife into him, he
struck him such a blow with his weapon that he fairly
cut him in two. This terrified the other Indians so that
they fled, while Causie ran to the settlements farther
inland to warn the whites of their peril. At a place called
Warrasqueake, a Mr. Baldwin stood off about fifty braves
with his musket, and by barricading himself in his
house finally drove the savages away single-handed.
Not far away from his home, two settlers held their
house against sixty Indians, and hit so many of the
screeching red men that the war party finally withdrew,
falling upon the house of a stout old historian, called
Ralph Hamer, who kept them off with a spade, armed
his sons with pitchforks and axes, and, as the Indians
had no guns, kept them away from his log hut, after a
battle lasting over two hours. At Martin's Hundred
a family of four persons hid in the cellar of their house
and were entirely overlooked by the yelping warriors,
although seventy-three of the English settlers were slain
near by. With horrible yells of delight, the Indians
mutilated the dead bodies of the slain and tortured the
dying settlers with the cruelest of devices.</p>

<p>At Jamestown a fortunate incident occurred. A
settler, living just opposite the town, had an Indian
servant called Chanco. This red man's brother told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
him of the proposed attack on the day before the outbreak,
so, running to his master, Chanco cried out,
"Quick, quick, you must run away. Opechancanough,
he come tomorrow with his men, and murder you."</p>

<p>"How do you know this, Chanco?" asked the startled
Colonist.</p>

<p>"My brother, he tell me just now. Quick, to the settlements."</p>

<p>Now, believing what his servant told him, the settler
ran to the shore, leaped into a boat, and rowing rapidly
across the James River, warned the inhabitants of
Jamestown of their peril. They quickly armed themselves,
mounted their howitzers on the stockade, closed
the gates, and presented such a formidable appearance to
the followers of Opechancanough when they appeared
before the walls next day, that they quickly withdrew
into the forest.</p>

<p>The first attack was over, but war had just begun.
The settlers deserted their cabins and gathered in the
larger towns for mutual defense. Their smaller towns&mdash;like
Henrico and Charles City&mdash;were abandoned, their
scattered plantations were deserted, their iron works and
glass works were given up, their fields of corn and
vineyards were destroyed, and the men armed for revenge
upon Opechancanough, the cruel. A body of
soldiers was formed&mdash;called the Long Knives&mdash;who
carried muskets and exceedingly sharp dirks which they
would plunge into an Indian's hide with as much pleasure
as they stuck them into the dead carcass of a deer.
All but six plantations were left to their fate and there
had been eighty prosperous farms on the James River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Three overseers and owners refused to leave their
property, mounted cannon on stockades around their
houses, armed their servants, and determined to give
the Indians a severe drubbing if they ever dared to attack
them. The forests and underbrush near all the
houses of the whites were burned for several miles, so
there would be no protection to the skulking savages,
and these&mdash;not daring to make an attack in force&mdash;made
short and sudden incursions on the settlements,
carrying off corn, cattle, and sometimes unfortunate
people. The whites gave the red men no quarter when
they caught them. The Long Knives were as bloodthirsty
as were the savages themselves.</p>

<p>So many whites had been captured by the Indians
that the Governor at Jamestown finally sent some envoys
to treat with Opechancanough for their exchange.</p>

<p>"I shall not do aught that you wish of me," replied
the haughty Chief to the requests of the ambassadors.
"Am I not King of this country? Do I not own it by
direct descent from my parents? Does the Indian not
hold this land from the Great Father? And, as for this
picture of the Great Father of the English which you
bring me," here he turned to a portrait of James the
First which the envoys had given him, "to show my
feelings for him, I hereby step on him." So saying,
he threw the portrait upon the ground and put his foot
so heavily upon the face of good King James that he
broke it into a hundred portions. Thus, seeing that they
could have no effect upon the irate monarch, the envoys
withdrew to their canoes and paddled home to Jamestown,
as angry as it is possible to conceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The imagination can well picture what the feelings
of the settlers must have been at this time. Surrounded
in the forest by a skulking foe who watched their movements
with vindictive hatred, they feared to venture
into the open unless in numbers and well armed.
Forced to flee from their plantations, they huddled together
in the stockaded towns like so many sheep, unable
to till any fields save those in the vicinity of their
own fortifications, and continually fired at (while ploughing
or working upon their harvests) by the lurking
savages. A few of their numbers had escaped from
the hands of the Indians and had brought news of
torture which made the blood boil and which the pen
cannot picture. The smouldering ruins of their once
peaceful homes dotted the surrounding country. Wives,
sisters, children, had fallen before the ruthless tomahawk,
and, stirred by feelings of the greatest hatred,
the white men longed for an opportunity to have a fair
fight with the crafty redskins; and so busily made
bullets for serving in an advance into the land of the
enemy.</p>

<p>In the autumn and winter of 1622, a series of attacks
upon the savages was made by the irate white men. More
Indians are said to have been slain at this time than had
ever fallen before the hands of the English since the
settlement of Jamestown. And the tactics employed
by the Colonists do not show them to have been the
men of sweet and gentle disposition which they are
often said to have been, for, in order to get even with
their red enemies, they availed themselves of a stratagem
as cruel and treacherous as any which the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
utilized against the whites. A peace was offered to the
followers of Opechancanough, which they accepted, and
the understanding was had between red men and whites
that the savages would be left alone while they planted
and harvested their corn crop. So, believing in the
word of the palefaces, the Indians tilled the soil, planted
their corn, and were about to harvest it, when the English
surrounded them, fell upon them in all directions
at a given hour upon an appointed day, killed
hundreds of the defenseless savages, and destroyed a
vast quantity of provisions. Among these cruelly
murdered were several of the most famous war captains,
and for some time Opechancanough, himself, was said to
be among the slain, a rumor which caused great rejoicing
among the whites. But&mdash;after some months&mdash;it was
learned that this crafty chieftain was still at large and as
active as ever before.</p>

<p>"I shall yet have the head of this arch conspirator,"
cried Governor Wyatt, when news was brought him that
Opechancanough was alive. "Come, men, we will
march against this murderous varlet, raze his village to
the ground, and chase him into the foothills of the Blue
Ridge." He had no need to urge on the Virginian Long
Knives; they were only too anxious for an opportunity
to attack the despoiler of the peace of their adopted
country, so, in the spring of 1625, a goodly body of stout
rangers pushed into the forest in the direction of Pamunkey&mdash;the
stronghold of the Chief of the Chickahominies.
Their advance was cautious, stealthy, sure, yet, as they
came to the vicinity of the Indian town, wild cries
echoed from every side, they were shot at from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
brush, and, before they realized it, they were in a furious
melée with the followers of Opechancanough. But the
Long Knives knew how to fight in Indian fashion, and
crouching behind logs and fallen trees, they soon began
to pick off the screeching braves, who darted from tree
to tree in the endeavor to dodge the straight shots of
the palefaces. The fight was hot and furious. The
Long Knives pressed on to Pamunkey, and, although the
red men made a stout rally before the village, they were
beaten back, only to see the smoke soon curling from
their burning wigwams and storehouses. Governor
Wyatt, in person, now urged on his men to a renewed
attack on the braves, and, although the Indians were
beaten off through the forest, the whites could not pursue
them as far as Mattapony, only four miles distant,
and the principal depot and rallying point of Opechancanough.
Satisfied with the day's work, the English
now retreated to their own settlements, leaving
the Indians in full possession of their most valued
town.</p>

<p>The war had now lasted for three years, and in spite
of all their efforts, the English had not driven the Indians
from their rallying places and settlements. "By heaven,
they know how to fight," said stout Governor Wyatt,
"and this Opechancanough is more than a match for us.
But I will catch them again with the same stratagem
which I used before, and I will wipe these treacherous
war dogs from the soil of this country." So saying, he
sent a proclamation to the Chickahominies and Pamunkies,
requesting them to come to a certain place for a
conference, where he intended to surround and capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
most of them. But the plan failed of success, and these
Indians&mdash;under the direct guidance of Opechancanough&mdash;were
more troublesome than ever. At this period they
refused absolutely to have anything to do with either
Wyatt or his representatives. The skirmishing went
on for four years between the angry white men and the
bloodthirsty red warriors, and at the end of that time,
a march was made by the Indian braves towards Jamestown,
which so alarmed the Governor that he collected
every available man to stem the outbreak.</p>

<p>The two armies met in a stout skirmish soon afterwards.
It was a hot fight, and, as usual, the Indians
were worsted in the affair. They withdrew to the
forest, beaten but not overawed, while the Colonists
were too much injured to follow them. A peace commission
was now sent to Opechancanough, but he refused
to listen to any overtures from the whites. He
scoffed at all ideas of a settlement of the difficulties which
lay between himself and the Colonists, and withdrew in
sullen anger into the forest. "By all that I love," cried
Governor Wyatt, "I will force this fellow to treat with
me," and sending a large armed force towards Pamunkey,
some time later, he secured a temporary truce with the
fierce Opechancanough. But so little dependence was
placed on it, that, while the commissioners on both sides
were adjusting the preliminaries, a proclamation was
issued by the Governor which forbade the Colonists from
either parleying or trading with the Indians. The truce
was understood to be only a temporary affair, yet for
nine years no further hostilities occurred between the
settlers from England and the red men. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
more and more white Colonists came to Virginia. The
settlements rapidly increased in size, while the Indians,
through disease and lack of medical knowledge, did not
increase with any great rapidity.</p>

<p>Opechancanough was not yet a friend to the white
man, although he was apparently upon friendly and
peaceable terms with the Colonists. Nursing his anger
and resentment, he remained at his home in the forest,
meditating upon the best means for expelling the English
from the country and secretly forming a plan for
another massacre of the plantation owners. Moody,
vindictive, sour, the old Chieftain would sit gloomily
before his wigwam, speculating upon the future and
dreaming of the cheerful moment when he would be able
to have Virginia for his own people. Thus he brooded,
while dissensions grew among the Colonists and an insurrection
against the Governor of Virginia took place
among the English. The time had again come for
Opechancanough to strike. The moment had arrived
which he had waited for through nine long years, and,
rousing himself from the torpor which had held him for
this period, he determined upon a great and decisive
blow which would rid him forever of the accursed
English.</p>

<p>The great Chieftain was now very aged. His voice
shook as he gave his orders. Yet, when he had sent out
word for a gathering of his warriors, his commands were
taken to the very remotest tribes of his confederacy
with speed and accuracy. As in the first outbreak, he
again determined to attack the scattered settlements at
a certain time, to station large forces near the points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to be assaulted, and to give the more distant posts to the
leading Chiefs of the several nations in his confederacy
of Indian tribes. He, himself, was to lead the advance
against the settlements nearest to Mattapony; the whole
Indian force was to assemble without making any noise,
and if any brave was found who had breathed a word of
the conspiracy, he was to be immediately shot to death
and all his family with him. The whites were to be
completely annihilated, and no quarter was to be shown
to either women, children, or aged persons. It was a
great design, well thought out, carefully concealed, and
thoroughly prepared. Let us see how it succeeded.</p>

<p>When the signal for attack was given, the hidden
warriors poured forth from the forest, and swept down
upon the plantations like a flight of locusts. As in the
massacre many years before, the Colonists were totally
unprepared for this sudden advance, and, at first, hundreds
of them fell before the raiding parties of the bloodthirsty
red men. Five hundred men, women, and
children perished under the tomahawks of the followers
of Opechancanough: the scourge of Virginia. Many
others were carried away in captivity. Their log houses,
supplies of corn, household utensils, farming instruments,
and live stock were destroyed. Their houses were
burned with all that they contained. Only a few, who
lived in the remotest plantations, were able to make
an escape to the more thickly populated portions of
Virginia and warn the inhabitants that the Indians were
again upon the war path. Dissensions among the
Colonists were speedily forgotten. Under the dread of
a frightful slaughter, the settlers, who had been warring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
with each other, determined to march together against
the red men. Their ploughs were left in the furrows.
All who were able to bear arms were enrolled in a militia
in defense of the Colony, and a chosen body, under the
command of Governor Berkeley, marched into the
enemy's country. Blood was in their eyes, and in their
hearts was the one word&mdash;revenge.</p>

<p>The fighting which now occurred was bloody. No
historian has left a record of it, but we can well imagine
how the infuriated Englishmen fell upon the followers
of Opechancanough when they found them. The
Indians were checked in their advance upon the peaceful
settlers. They were beaten back, defeated again and
again, and were forced to give up their invasion. Berkeley's
troops were light-armed and lightly dressed, so
that they could move with speed against the little warriors
of the forest. Some of them had horses and on
these they could often head off the flying redskins and
effect their capture. They did great damage and often
routed the followers of Opechancanough when the
battle which they were fighting with the English was
very even.</p>

<p>As for Opechancanough, himself, he had become
extremely feeble and decrepit from old age and was
unable to walk. Borne about on a litter by four
stout braves, he directed the fighting of his warriors
and, although weak in body, still possessed a
proud and imperious spirit. His flesh became macerated,
his sinews lost their elasticity, and his eyelids were
so heavy that he could not see, unless they were lifted up
by the hands of his faithful attendants. In this forlorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
condition he was directing the course of a battle, when
Berkeley's horse burst through the thicket in the rear
of his men, and, terrified by fear of capture, his own attendants
were forced to run away. The great Chief was
left upon the ground, and soon a cheering body of Colonists
stood around him, howling with the pleasure of
having taken&mdash;after years of attempt&mdash;the bold, resolute
Chief of the Chickahominies and their allied tribes.
By special command of Governor Berkeley he was carefully
carried to Jamestown, where people crowded around
in wonder to see the fallen monarch of the Virginian
wildwood.</p>

<p>The English had now lost their vindictive hatred for
this wily monarch. They saw the man who had inspired
such terror in a forlorn and abject condition.
Shattered by age and misfortune, he presented a sorry
appearance, as he lay, half dead, upon the litter of
boughs and deerskins which his own people had fashioned
for him. To the honor of the Colonists, they treated
the distinguished captive with tenderness and the respect
which his appearance and talents demanded,
while he, himself, was as proud and haughty as a Roman
Emperor. He uttered no complaint or showed no uneasiness
at his capture. Fearing that he would be
tortured, he showed no humility, and was imperious,
defiant, and spirited in his language and demeanor. So,
he lay, curiously gazed upon by the gaping Colonists,
and eagerly watched by the soldiers who had effected
his capture.</p>

<p>Opechancanough reclined thus for several days attended
by his affectionate Indian servants, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
begged permission to wait upon him. He was near
ninety years of age, and it is said that Governor Berkeley
proposed to take him to England, as a living argument
to counteract the representations made by some
persons in that country, that Virginian climate was too
unhealthy for any one to gain long life who resided there.
The great Chief was reserved and silent, and, as if
anxious to show his English enemies that there was
nothing in their presence to even arouse his curiosity,
he rarely allowed his attendants to raise his eyelids.
Thus he was lying, when one of the soldiers set to guard
him raised his gun, and, in a spirit of revenge for all the
suffering which the great Chieftain had caused, shot
him through the back. He was grievously wounded,
but did not die immediately.</p>

<p>To the last moment of his life, the haughty Opechancanough
preserved the dignity and serenity of his bearing.
He made no murmur of pain or fear and stolidly
awaited the end which was rapidly approaching. Only
a few moments before he expired he heard an unusual
amount of noise in the room where he lay, and requesting
his attendants to raise his eyelids, saw a number
of Colonists crowding around him in order to gratify
their curiosity and amazement. The dying Chieftain
raised himself weakly upon one arm, and, with a voice
and air of authority, asked that Governor Berkeley be
immediately called in. When the latter made his appearance,
Opechancanough cried out, in a thin and
trembling voice: "Had it been my fortune, sir, to have
taken Sir William Berkeley prisoner, I should never have
exposed you as a show for my people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>A few hours later the mighty Sachem breathed his
last, amid the weepings and lamentations of his Indian
attendants. He had been an implacable enemy to the
whites; he had led two fairly successful insurrections
against them, and he had been the cause of untold
misery and suffering. Yet, he felt that his cause was a
just one; he saw that he must either exterminate the
English or they would exterminate his own people, and
he fought for the preservation of his race. His own
countrymen were more under his control than under
that of Powhatan, himself, and they considered him to
be in no way related to Powhatan, but represented him
as a prince of a foreign nation, come from a great distance
somewhere in the southwest: probably Mexico.
He has been called by some a politic and haughty
prince, and one English statesman has named him
the Hannibal of Virginia. At any rate he was a man
of influence, power, and ability. His record is a good
one for an Indian, and had his followers been possessed
of the knowledge of civilization and warfare which the
white men held, there is little doubt that Virginia, for
many years, would have been the exclusive habitation
of the redskins. Peace to the ashes of misguided and
unfortunate Opechancanough of Virginia. He fought
for a cause which, from his viewpoint, was as just as that
of his conquerors. He was never captured in battle until
old age made it impossible for him to escape, and he
died by a foul and unexpected blow, from one of a race
which should be well ashamed of such a deed.</p>

<h2>SASSACUS AND UNCAS: RIVAL CHIEFTAINS OF THE PEQUOT REBELLION</h2>


<p>The English are an adventurous people and none
were more so than burly Captain Stone, a hardy
mariner, who, in the summer of 1633, made a
coastwise trip from Maine to Virginia in a little schooner.
Attracted by the broad harbor of the Connecticut
River, he sailed by the rocky bluffs at the entrance
and was soon gliding between the green hills which
roll back from either side of the sparkling waters of the
stream. Charmed by the peaceful scene, he kept on
drifting up the winding water course, until he finally
dropped anchor beneath a headland covered with the
sweet-scented bushes of the sumach and wild plum.</p>

<p>"It seems that this is a likely place for the partridge
or grouse," said one of the seamen, as the ship lay
peacefully at anchor on the quiet water. "What say
you, good Captain, if I and two others go ashore with our
fowling pieces to look for game?"</p>

<p>"Good," answered the stout Captain, "and if you
see a deer, be sure and bring it down, for we are much
in need of fresh meat upon our vessel."</p>

<p>"All right, we will go at once," said the seaman, and,
quickly selecting two companions who armed themselves
with flintlocks, the sporting sea-dogs were soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>ashore. That night they did not come back, but, thinking
that they had wandered off in the quest of venison,
Captain Stone did not give the matter a second thought.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, a canoe, filled with Indians,
was seen coming from the shore. "How! How!" said
the red men, when the canoe came near the ship. "We
bring presents to white man. We want to see big house
on water."</p>

<p>A Sachem of the Pequot Indians was in the bow of
the birch-bark boat, and, as he smiled in a friendly
fashion, the Captain gave orders that he should be allowed
to come on board with all his dozen men. Not
long afterwards, he was agreeably conversing with
them in his cabin. The crew were in the cook room,
getting their luncheon, when, overcome by the drowsy
heat of the day, and with no suspicion that the redskins
were other than peaceful braves, the Captain fell
asleep in his bunk.</p>

<p>Silently the Indians sneaked to the cupboard&mdash;where
the muskets were kept&mdash;and seized them. Then, when
all were passed to the waiting braves, the Sachem crept
over to the sleeping Captain Stone, and, with one swift
blow, brained him with his hatchet. Immediately his
followers rushed to the small room where the crew were
peacefully eating, and, aiming at them through the
window, shot at those who were nearest. All leaped
to their feet and made a rush for the door in order to
grapple with their assailants. Three lay groaning upon
the floor, as the rest rushed upon the vindictive savages
who, using their knives and spears, cut at the sailors
with cruel vengeance. A desperate struggle commenced.</p>

<p>The whites and Pequots struggled back and forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
upon the narrow deck, which now grew slippery with
blood. More than one savage was knocked overboard,
but, as they outnumbered the crew, it was plainly evident
that the outcome of the struggle would be in their
favor. Suddenly, a loud report was heard. The decks
flew asunder from the force of an explosion below. The
splitting timbers belched outwards upon the blue
waters of the quiet stream, and, with a muffled roar,
both red men and white were shot into the water.
Some clung to the wreckage, some hung on to the canoe
and boats, as&mdash;in lurid flames and black smoke&mdash;the
remains of the little schooner were burned to the water's
edge. But, although hurled into the water, most of
the Pequots escaped, were picked up by their companions,
and paddled back in the canoes and ship's boats
to complete the massacre. When night came, only a
few charred timbers, floating upon the surface of the
Connecticut, were left to mark the scene of the tragedy.</p>

<p>This was in 1633, when the Puritans were well established
at Plymouth and Boston, and were continually
pushing into the interior to find good farm lands.
Sassacus was Chief Sachem of the warlike Pequots,
and, in spite of this massacre, sent a messenger to the
Governor of Massachusetts&mdash;in the year following&mdash;to
gain his friendship and alliance. His emissary
brought two large bundles of sticks with him and a
large quantity of wampum. "I will give as many skins
of the beaver and otter as I send pieces of wood," was
the message which King Sassacus sent to the Chief
Executive of Massachusetts, "and I wish your friendship
and allegiance. Will you sign a treaty with me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I return you a fine moose-skin coat," answered the
Governor to this request, "but I cannot make a treaty
with you unless you send proper warriors for me to treat
with, and enough of them. Furthermore, your men
have murdered Captain Stone, my friend, and I can
make no peace with you until you deliver to me the
Pequots who killed him and his men."</p>

<p>Sassacus was a warrior of high renown. He had
twenty-six sachems, or war captains, under his control,
and could muster&mdash;at any time&mdash;seven hundred warriors.
His residence was upon the Atlantic, at Groton, Connecticut,
and near the Mystic River he had a splendid stronghold,
situated upon a verdant eminence, which gradually
descended to the waters of the sparkling stream. He
and his men looked upon the English as intruders, who
had no right to come to the soil of Connecticut. But,
as the intrepid Sassacus had warred with the Dutch at
New York, so that they had cut off his trade with them,
he wished to now gain the good will of the English, near
Boston. The Pequots were men of the utmost independence
of spirit and had conquered most of the smaller
tribes lying around them. They called these people
whom they captured "women" and "cowards."</p>

<p>"Your Captain Stone took two of our men," said
the emissary from Sassacus. "He detained them by
force and made them pilot him up the river. The
Captain and the crew then landed, taking the guides
on shore, with their hands bound behind them. The
Pequots next fell upon the white men and killed them.
The vessel, with the remainder of the crew, was blown
up, I do not know why, nor wherefore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a pretty good story, and as the Governor of
Massachusetts could not substantiate his own side, he
was inclined to believe it, for he had no means of proving
its falsity. So a treaty was concluded, with the following
terms:</p>

<p>I. The English to have such land in Connecticut as
they needed, provided they would make a settlement
there; and the Pequots to render them all the assistance
that they could.</p>

<p>II. The Pequots to give the English four hundred
fathoms of wampum, forty beaver and thirty otter skins,
and to surrender the two murderers whenever they
should be sent for.</p>

<p>III. The English to send a vessel immediately, to
trade with them, as friends, but not to fight them, and
the Pequots would give them all their custom.</p>

<p>Having signed this document, the emissary from
Sassacus and his companion started back on their five
days' journey to the habitation of their Chief. But,
unfortunately for them, the Pequots were then at war
with the Narragansetts, and a party of about two hundred
and fifty warriors of the latter tribe had come as far
as Neponset (the boundary between Milton and Dorchester)
for the avowed purpose of waylaying and killing
the two Pequots on their way home. Learning of this,
the Governor sent an armed force to request a visit from
these Narragansett braves, and two Sachems&mdash;with
about twenty men&mdash;obeyed the summons. "We have
been hunting around the country," said they, "and
came to visit the Indians at Neponset, according to
old custom. We meant no harm to the Pequots. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
can go home in safety." And they kept good this
promise, so that the two Pequots made their return
trip in perfect security.</p>

<p>For two years white settlers moved into Connecticut,
and took up farms in the most fertile places. But the
Indians were soon unfriendly. An Englishman named
Oldham, who had been trading in Connecticut, was
murdered by a party of Block Island braves, several of
whom were said&mdash;by the frontier settlers&mdash;to have taken
refuge among the Pequots, who gave them ample protection.
When the Governor of Massachusetts heard
of this, he was exceedingly wroth, for Oldham was a
resident of Dorchester and was a friend of his. So,
ordering Captain Endicott of the State Militia to appear
before him, he said:</p>

<p>"I commission you, good sir, to put to death the
redskins of Block Island, with ninety of our soldiers.
Spare the women and children, but bring them away
and take possession of the Island. Then go to the
Pequots and demand the murderers of Captain Stone,
Oldham, and other Englishmen who have been killed,
and one thousand fathom of wampum for damages. Also
get some of their children as hostages, which, if they
refuse, you must take by force."</p>

<p>Endicott was not long in starting upon his mission,
and soon had captured Block Island and burned the
villages of the natives. He then sailed for Pequot
Harbor, where a warrior of the army under Sassacus
came out in a canoe to demand who the intruders were.
The River Thames, where now the rival crews of Yale
and Harvard struggle for supremacy on the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
emptied into this harbor, and upon either bank were the
homes of the Indians.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Sassacus, your Chief," said Endicott.</p>

<p>"He has gone to Long Island," the Indian replied.</p>

<p>"Then I wish to speak with the next in authority,"
continued the leader of the Massachusetts troops, "and
I wish to have the murderers of Oldham given up to my
care."</p>

<p>The Pequot brave did not reply and paddled to the
shore, followed by the English troops, who landed and
stood&mdash;fully armed&mdash;a short distance from the beach.
The Indians in numbers gathered around them, but
the head Sachem did not put in an appearance. "He
will come," said the fellow who had been in the canoe,
"if you English will lay down your arms. We will, at
the same time, leave our bows and arrows at a distance."</p>

<p>But Endicott grew angry at this, as he believed it to
be a pretext for gaining time. "Begone, you Pequots,"
he thundered. "You have dared the English to come
and fight you, and we are ready." The Indians withdrew
to a short distance, and then the leader of the
whites ordered his men to advance. A shower of arrows
poured upon them, as they did so, but the English discharged
a hot volley which killed several and wounded
fully twenty of the redskins. At this they fled, while
the troops pressed on to their village and burned it to
the ground.</p>

<p>At night the little army returned to the five ships
which had brought them, and next day they went ashore
upon the west side of the river and burned all the wigwams
and smashed all the canoes of the Pequots' families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
who lived upon the bank of the Thames. The Indians
shot at them from behind rocks and trees, but their
arrows did little damage, and so, with the loss of not a
single man, the troops set sail for Boston. "They came
home all safe," says a historian, "which was a marvelous
providence of God, that not a hair fell from the head of
any of them, nor were there any sick or wounded in
the little army."</p>

<p>Sassacus was now infuriated with the whites. In
retaliation for this attack upon his people, he ordered
war upon the white settlers of Connecticut. The forts
and settlements of the English were assaulted in every
direction. No boat could pass up and down the Connecticut
River in safety. The hard-working farmers
could neither hunt, fish, nor cultivate their lands. People
went armed to their work in the fields and to church on
Sunday, while a guard was stationed outside the meeting
houses during service. At the mouth of the Connecticut
River, the English had a fortification, called
Fort Saybrook. In October five of the garrison were
surprised and killed, as they were carrying in some
hay from a field near by. Not long afterwards several
vessels were captured, and the sailors were tortured by
the Pequots. Saybrook Fort was besieged, the outhouses
were burned, and the few cattle that were not
killed often came in at night with the arrows of the Pequot
warriors sticking in their sides. Early in March four
of the garrison were caught outside the walls of the fort
and massacred, while a horde of red warriors surrounded
the stockade on all sides, challenging the English to come
out and fight in the open, mocking them with catcalls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
groans, hisses, and imitations of the screams of those
whom they had captured, and boasting that the Pequots
would soon drive all the English into the sea. They
would often rush up to the gate in the endeavor to gain
an entrance, but a discharge of grapeshot from a cannon
made them retreat into the timber.</p>

<p>It is said that a Puritan, or a New Englander, is slow
to anger, but once get him aroused and he will fight as
no other man can fight on earth. This is what put an
end to Sassacus. For when the savage marauders
threatened Agawam (Springfield), Hartford and Windsor,
and carried off several women from Wethersfield,
the Massachusetts colony sent an army of ninety men
to Saybrook Fort, commanded by Captain John Mason,
an experienced and able soldier. A body of Mohegan
Indians, under Uncas, joined them here, for they were
unfriendly to Sassacus, as he and his savage Pequots
had often killed the members of this tribe. They were to
prove of little value in the campaign, but their presence
added a spirit of confidence to the English soldiers.</p>

<p>At the head of the Mystic River, where now is the
thriving town of Stonington, Connecticut, Sassacus had
his principal fortification. It was really a large Indian
town, surrounded by a stout palisade, and was crowded
with men, women and children. Mason decided to attack
it, but, being a good soldier, determined to throw
the watchful Pequots off his scent. He, therefore, first
sailed down to the Pequot (Thames) River, and pretended
to land at its mouth. The savages were closely
watching him, and when, instead of landing, he bore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>away to the southward and coasted along the Narragansett
Bay, the natives thought that he was in retreat.
"Ugh! Ugh!" said the warriors. "He little heart.
He no fight! We brave men. We can beat all the
English in the country!"</p>

<p>But Mason was a shrewd campaigner, and dropping
anchor at a point in the bay, where he was protected
from the prying eyes of the Pequot scouts, he lay to for
some time, and then landed his soldiers through the
heavy surf which was then raging. Marching inland,
he stopped at a fort of the friendly Narragansetts, under
Canonicus and Miantonomo, who were cold and distrustful,
saying: "We doubt that such a small body of
you English can carry the strong palisades of Sassacus.
But we will help you when you advance upon them
tomorrow." Mason had so little confidence in the word
of these allies that he surrounded the fort, that evening,
with a strong guard, fearing that the Indians would betray
his approach to the Pequots.</p>

<p>Next day the little army of white soldiers pushed on
through the woods in the direction of the great Pequot
stronghold, where the followers of Sassacus were resting
in fancied peace and security. It was a hot day&mdash;the
25th of May&mdash;and the warriors were much oppressed
by their heavy armor breastplates and the weight
of their ponderous flintlocks. They forded the Pawcatuck
River and camped at a place called Porter's Rocks,
at the head of the Mystic River, which was but two miles
from the Pequot encampment. Scouts crept near the
palisades that evening, and heard the sounds of songs
and laughter within, for the redskins were having a big
feast. Perfectly unconscious of the peril that lurked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
so near them, some of the braves were boasting that the
English had fled without striking a blow to avenge the
death of thirty white settlers whose scalps hung in the
wigwams of the Pequot braves. They danced, sang,
and caroused until late in the night.</p>

<p>Mason passed among his men, and said: "Sleep lightly.
Arouse yourselves at the first flush of dawn. When you
strike the Indians, fight like bloodhounds. Give no
quarter, for they have given no quarter to our people."</p>

<p>Deep sleep hung over the Indian camp, as at daybreak
the Puritan army started for the stockade.
Guided by Uncas&mdash;the Mohegan chief&mdash;and Wequash, a
Pequot who had turned traitor to his tribe, they were
soon led to the outskirts of the sleeping village. A
hush of deep quiet hung over the habitations of Sassacus
and his people. Robins piped from the trees. Song-sparrows
trilled from the verdant underbrush, and the
flute-like call of thrushes came from the depth of the
wood, now beautiful with the fresh green of early
spring. It hardly seemed possible that scenes of dreadful
carnage would soon be enacted in the midst of this
quiet beauty, but silently and cautiously the men with
iron breastplates surrounded the circular stockade.
Behind them, their Indian allies formed a circle, but
advanced with no show of courage or enthusiasm. The
garrison slept peacefully on, when suddenly a dog
barked, and a Pequot warrior, leaping to his feet in alarm,
cried out, "Owanux! Owanux!"&mdash;"Englishmen! Englishmen!"</p>

<p>In front of Mason was a barricade of brush heaps at
one entrance to the village. Opposite this was another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
opening, and, as the stout yeomen rushed in one doorway,
led by Mason, an equal body penetrated the other,
cheered on by Underhill. The Pequot braves seized
their bows and arrows in a vain endeavor to stem the
onslaught, while the women and children&mdash;in terror&mdash;endeavored
to hide themselves beneath anything that
would cover them, or to escape between the lines and
gain the protection of the forest. Hoarse cries rose in
the misty air. Muskets crashed, children screamed, and,
with exultant war whoops, the followers of Uncas shot
their arrows into the Pequots, who huddled together like
sheep, in confusion and dismay. "We must burn
them!" shouted Mason, now full of the heat of battle,
and seizing a glowing brand from some smouldering
ashes, he thrust it between the sticks of a wigwam.
In a moment the mats, with which it was covered, were
alight, and the tepee blazed upwards in smoke and fire.
Many soldiers followed his example, so that soon the
yelling mass of warriors were surrounded by black
smoke and curling flames.</p>

<p>In an unyielding circle, the English pressed in upon
the Pequot braves. The flames crackled, women
shrieked, children cried, and above the rattling of the
firearms sounded the vindictive yelping of the followers
of Uncas. Seventy wigwams were soon black in smoke,
while fully five hundred Pequots were struck down as
they endeavored to get past the line of the Puritan
troops. The broad swords of the soldiers thrust this
way and that with terrible ferocity. Back, back, they
pressed the cringing and desperate redskins, who again
and again threw themselves upon the ranks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Puritans in a vain endeavor to get through to the safety
of the forest. Sassacus, himself, was not there, but his
people were receiving an awful chastisement for attacking
the peaceful settlers of Connecticut. They battled
desperately for their lives. They strove manfully to
penetrate the cordon of steel which pressed in upon
them, but it was in vain. Within an hour's time fully
six hundred of them lay dead or dying upon the sod,
while only seven escaped and seven were taken captive.</p>

<p>News of the disaster was quickly brought to Sassacus,
who, fortunately for himself, was in the next Pequot
stronghold, some miles distant. Dispatching immediately
three hundred warriors to the scene of carnage,
they pursued the English very closely for six miles, on
their march to their ships, which had sailed to the mouth
of the Pequot (Thames) River. The Narragansett
warriors who had come on with Mason's men had already
deserted. Uncas and his Mohegans still remained
faithful, and helped to carry the wounded back to the
ships. Underhill protected the rear of the white army
as it retreated, and, according to his own account, killed
and wounded near a hundred of the ferocious Pequots,
who burned to avenge the slaughter of the morning.
A third of Mason's men were used up from wounds or
exhaustion, but all arrived safely at the ocean side,
where not only were the ships, but also a reinforcement
of forty men from Boston. Before night closed in, all
were on board and safe from the attacks of the Pequots,
who shook their fists at them from the shore and yelled
vindictively at them, as the white sails filled in the
gentle breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The war was not over by any means. All through the
summer skirmishes were had with the Indians. Uncas
and his Mohegans, with a few English, were scouring
the shores near the sea for the purpose of cutting off
stragglers, when they came upon a Pequot Sachem and
a few of his men, not far from the harbor of Guilford,
Connecticut. They pursued them, and, as the south
side of the harbor is formed by a long neck of land, the
Pequots went out upon it, hoping that their pursuers
would pass by. But Uncas, who saw the stratagem,
ordered some of his Mohegans to give chase, which the
enemy observed and so jumped into the water and swam
over to the mouth of the harbor. There they were captured
by the English soldiers, who ran around to head
them off. Uncas, himself, is said to have shot the
chief sachem with an arrow, to have cut off his head,
and set it in the crotch of a large oak tree near the
water. The skull remained here for many years, and
thus the name of Sachem's-Head has ever since been
given to this beautiful harbor.</p>

<p>A large number of the Pequots now deserted Sassacus
to his fate and took refuge among the Indians of New
York. Some even threatened to destroy him for
bringing down upon them the anger of the white settlers,
and nothing but the entreaty of his chief counsellor
prevented him from being killed by his own people.
Realizing that he could no longer hold his own against
the whites, he destroyed his fort, and, with several
hundred of his best men, retreated towards the Hudson
River. To kill or capture him was the main object of
the Colonists, and, two captured Pequots having had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
their lives spared on condition that they would guide the
English to him, a good-sized force now pushed on
towards the retreating members of the once powerful
Pequot tribe. At last the Indians were overtaken near
Fairfield, Connecticut, and a fierce fight took place in
a swamp. The red men fought with the courage of
despair, and sixty or seventy succeeded in forcing their
way through the ranks of their assailants; but about two
hundred were captured. Sassacus, himself, escaped.
Those Pequots who had not been slain were hunted
like wild beasts by the other Indians of the Narragansett
and Mohegan tribes, and weekly their heads were
brought in to Windsor and Hartford. Finally, the
entire tribe was obliterated, and the few remaining
braves were permitted to live with those tribes which
they had called "cowards" and "women."</p>

<p>Sassacus was driven from swamp to swamp, by night
and by day. Even his own men hunted him and endeavored
to take his life. One Pequot who was freed
by the English, on condition that he would find and
betray this great chief, finally succeeded in finding him.
Creeping upon him in one of his solitary camps, he was
about to fire his musket, when he was overcome by the
majestic look of the great Sachem. "I could not pull
the trigger," he told the English, "for my chief looked
like all one God. I could not touch a hair of his head."
Thus the once powerful redskin escaped and fled to the
Mohawks in New York, where he arrived with five
hundred pounds of wampum and several of his best captains
and bravest men. But here there was to be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>peace for the fugitive. He and his men were treacherously
murdered by a party of warlike Mohawks, and his
scalp sent to Connecticut as a present to the English. A
lock of his hair was soon carried to Boston, where it was
exhibited in a window upon the streets, as a sure proof
of the death of this once powerful enemy to the whites.</p>

<p>Uncas&mdash;the Mohegan ally of the Connecticut settlers&mdash;continued
to live at peace with the Colonists,
although granting nearly all his land away for a very
small consideration. Thus, in 1641, he gave away
several thousand acres for the possession of four coats,
two kettles, four fathoms of wampum, four hatchets
and three hoes. In 1659 he gave all his lands, with all
his corn, to his old comrade and friend, Major John
Mason, with whom he had stormed the Pequot fort on
the Mystic. He lived to be a very old man, and a
remnant of his tribe still exists today near Norwich,
Connecticut, and are the only natives still lingering
upon the soil of the state.</p>

<p>Sassacus defied the English and was exterminated.
Uncas befriended them and lived a peaceful existence.
Of the two, he led the more quiet life, but one cannot
but admire the fierce, fighting spirit of Sassacus and
regret that he met such a miserable end. No direct
descendants of either now exist, for, upon an old Indian
gravestone at Mohegan, a genial carver has left the
following inscription:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lies the body of Sun-seeto<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Own son to Uncas, grandson to Oneko,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who were the famous Sachems of Mohegan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now they are all dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think it is Werheegen" (which means "all is well" or "good news" in the Mohegan language).<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>Certainly, the whites were glad to see the race exterminated.
It left the country to their own civilization,
and they developed it according to their own desires.
Now brick and wooden houses, great factories,
and roaring mills stand where the red men once had
their thin wigwams; and where they once battled
furiously with the stout Colonists, jangling trolley cars
rush by in cheerful indifference to the dim records of
history.</p>

<h2>MASSASOIT: THE GREAT SACHEM OF THE WAMPANOAGS AND FRIEND
OF THE PURITANS</h2>


<p>While the English were gradually settling their
plantations on the James River in Virginia and
were encroaching upon the land held by the
Indians, other Englishmen, driven from home by religious
persecution, and wishing to found a colony in the
newly discovered country, had crossed the blue Atlantic
to the rocky shore of Massachusetts, where they had
landed, built their log houses, and had begun to wrest
a living from a stern and unproductive soil. They were
Pilgrims and were of a religious sect called Puritans,
which was most unpopular in their native country.
All were men of sturdy, vigorous natures.</p>

<p>These adventurers first went ashore upon the fifteenth
day of November, and a few walked up and down until
the sun began to draw low, when they hastened out of
the woods in order that they might enter their boat
which was drawn up upon the beach. By the time that
they reached it, it was nearly dusk, so, after setting a
watch, those who had landed lay down to rest.</p>

<p>About midnight they heard a great and hideous cry
from out the woodland, and their sentinel called out,
"Arm! Arm!" So they leaped to their feet, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
seizing some muskets which were beside them, shot them
off. As they did so, again the terrible wail sounded
from the forest.</p>

<p>"Woach! Woach! Ha-Ha-Ha-Hack&mdash;Woach!"</p>

<p>But this soon ceased, and all was quiet in the sombre
woodland.</p>

<p>Nothing more occurred until about five in the morning,
when one of the Puritans came running to the camp,
shouting: "Men are coming to attack us! Indians!
Indians!" And, as he spoke, a cloud of arrows came
flying into the encampment. One savage was soon seen
who fired at them from behind a tree, and an old
Puritan took three shots at him with a musket.</p>

<p>The red man continued to shoot his arrows until suddenly
he gave a terrific yell, showing that he had probably
been hit. At any rate he retreated into the dense
forest with the other braves, and nothing more was seen,
or heard, either from him, or from them.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims breathed a sigh of relief, picked up the
arrows&mdash;eighteen in all had fallen among them&mdash;and
marveled at their make. Some were curiously headed
with the horn of a buck deer, and others with the claw
of an eagle. So they kept them, and, when the good
ship Mayflower sailed for England, they sent these
warlike tokens back with her to their friends upon the
other side of the Atlantic. The Indians who had made
this assault were Nansets, of whom Aspinet was the
chief, but whether or not any of them were slain in the
conflict does not appear in the ancient record of this
combat.</p>

<p>After this affair the sober Puritans made their abode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and sailed carelessly along the coast, looking for a good
landing place, until December 11th, when they reached
a spot which had a good harbor and some high ground
beyond the beach which offered an excellent situation
for a redoubt. So here they landed, built a long log
house, and began their first settlement upon New
England soil. They called their first home Plymouth.</p>

<p>With great toil and hard labor they erected other
habitations for the settlers. Their first winter here
was one of extreme hardship and suffering. Many died
of starvation and exposure, and when spring came
the survivors were so enfeebled that an attack by a
strong band of Indians could easily have annihilated
the entire settlement.</p>

<p>On March 16th, 1621, the chief men of Plymouth
had assembled to discuss various matters of interest
in connection with the welfare of the country, when
an Indian was seen approaching. With long strides
he walked down the village street, and, as the wary
Puritans sprang to their guns, he held out his hands,
and cried, "Welcome, Englishmen! Welcome!"</p>

<p>He was a tall, straight man, the hair on his head was
black&mdash;short before and long behind&mdash;his countenance
was open and friendly, while his carriage was graceful
and imposing. He was thinly clad in deer skins, which
must have afforded small warmth for the cold air of
spring, and his moccasins gave scarcely any protection
to his hardened feet. The Colonists laid aside their
guns, when they realized that the savage was not armed,
and grasped the outstretched hand of the friendly
neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are glad to see you," spoke one of the hardy
Englishmen, "and, as you have shown yourself to be
friendly, we too shall be friendly."</p>

<p>"Come, seat yourself among us and partake of our
humble fare!</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh!" grunted the savage, squatting down
upon the ground, "I am Samoset, Pemaquid chief.
My hunting ground on Island Monhegan, a day's sail
toward the rising sun. Five days if go by land, near
Penobscot River. Welcome, Englishmen, to country of
Massasoit. I learn your tongue from white fishermen
who come here not long ago."</p>

<p>This speech sounded as if it were true, so, feeling
compassion for the poor, naked child of the woods, the
settlers presented him with a hat, a pair of stockings,
shoes, a shirt, and a piece of cloth to tie around his
waist. They learned that the country around them
was called Pawtuxet, and that, four years before their
arrival, a terrible pestilence had swept off all the tribes
which had inhabited this district, so that, as none were
left to claim the soil, it would be perfectly possible for
the English to do so. Samoset also told them that their
nearest neighbor was a powerful Sachem called Massasoit,
who was chief of the Wampanoag tribe, as well as
head sachem of the Pokanoket Confederacy of thirty
allied tribes. This mighty chieftain was disposed to
be friendly, continued Samoset, but neighboring Indians,
called Nansets, had been greatly angered by the
English, because some years before, a certain Captain
Hunt had kidnapped over twenty of their number
and sold them into slavery. It would, therefore, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
well for the settlers, said the obliging Samoset, if they
had no dealings with this particular clan, but restricted
their trade and intercourse with the followers of Massasoit.
After a lengthy discussion of the climate, the
country, and the people, the friendly savage departed
with smiles and bows, which showed that he was apparently
much pleased with the reception which the
English had given him.</p>

<p>The unwarlike visitor soon returned with four others,
who also professed to be friendly, and who sang and
danced in an open space before the settlement to amuse
the sturdy and determined Puritans. Among them
was Squanto, an Indian who spoke excellent English,
because he had been among those whom the English,
under Captain Hunt, had kidnapped and sold into
slavery in Malaga, for eighty pounds (four hundred
dollars) each, but had been ransomed and liberated by
kind-hearted monks and sent to England. Here, at
Cornhill, he learned to make himself understood in very
good English, and obtained the friendship and sympathy
of a wealthy merchant, who housed him, fed him, and
eventually shipped him back to his native shore in a
sailing vessel, commanded by Captain Thomas Dermer.
This stout old sea-dog found that all of Squanto's race
had died of a pestilence (probably smallpox) and,
therefore, delivered him to Massasoit, whose loyal subject
he became, and with whom he was now living.
The Indians disposed of a few skins and fish, and then
departed, telling the settlers that the great chief Massasoit,
with his brother and all his warriors, was near
at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The first appearance of the Chief of the Wampanoags
was upon the 22d of March, 1621, when he arrived
upon a hill opposite Plymouth, with sixty warriors
gaudily arrayed in their best deerskin raiment. Massasoit
is described by one of the settlers as being "a very
lusty man, in his best years, with an able body, grave of
countenance and spare of speech." In his attire he
differed little from the rest of his followers, save that he
wore a large chain of white bone beads about his neck
which had suspended from it behind a little bag of
tobacco. His face was painted a darkish red, and both
his head and face were so oiled that he looked very
greasy. The only weapon upon his person was a long
knife swinging from his bosom by a string; although his
attendants carried war clubs, knives, and bows and
arrows. Some of his followers&mdash;all tall, strong men&mdash;were
painted black, others red, yellow, and white. They
were dressed in furs or skins of various kinds, and made
a very good showing&mdash;such a good showing, indeed,
that the English feared an attack and stood prepared
for any sign of violence that the Wampanoags might offer.</p>

<p>The Indians seemed to be unwilling to approach any
nearer, and, as they hesitated, the English determined
to find out why they would not advance. As luck
would have it, Squanto was in Plymouth, so he was
dispatched to ascertain their designs, and they gave him
to understand that they wished to have some one sent
to hold a parley with them. So Edward Winslow was
selected to go over to their position with presents to the
sachem and with directions to endeavor to patch up a
treaty of peace. Winslow was an excellent diplomat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
he addressed them in a speech of some length, and,
although the Wampanoags listened with much gravity,
it is doubtful whether or not they understood it thoroughly,
although an Indian interpreter explained the
gallant Winslow's words, after he had spoken. The
Englishman told them that King James of England
sent his best and kindest regards to Massasoit, his
brother, and that he hoped to have him as his friend
and ally. Furthermore, that the Governor of Plymouth
wished to see him and to treat with him upon terms of
the greatest friendliness. Massasoit listened with polite
attention, and seems to have made no special reply to
this harangue, but to have gazed upon the sword and
armor of the Captain with envious eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish to buy your iron breastplate and your war
instruments," said the old chief, through the interpreter,
as Winslow paused for breath. "What do you wish
for them?"</p>

<p>The Captain smiled with good humor. "They are not
for sale, my friend," said he. "For I need them sorely
in my duties among my own people."</p>

<p>"I will go among them," said Massasoit, rising.
"And I will leave you with my brother, while I and
twenty of my men walk over to the English camp."</p>

<p>So saying, he crossed the brook between him and
the English, taking twenty of the Wampanoags, who
were directed to leave their bows and arrows behind
them. Captain Miles Standish and another Puritan,
with six armed men, met him beyond the water, exchanged
salutations with the majestic Indian, and took
him to one of the best houses in the village. A stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
arch has, in late years, been thrown over this brook to
show where this first meeting between the great chief
and the whites took place, while the hill upon which
the Indians camped&mdash;called "Strawberry Hill"&mdash;is still
pointed out to those who are interested in the history
of America.</p>

<p>In the cabin to which Massasoit was conducted a
green rug was placed upon the floor and three or four
cushions were piled upon it, in order to make it comfortable.
After the noted chieftain had gone inside, the
Governor of Plymouth entered the house, followed by
several soldiers who beat a drum loudly and blared upon
a trumpet, which delighted and astonished the Wampanoags.
The Governor hurried up to the Sachem,
and seizing him in his arms, kissed him upon the cheek,
a salutation which was immediately returned by the
chief, and, considering the fact that he was covered
with both grease and red paint, it could not have been
a very satisfactory affair for the Englishman. He
made no grievance, however, and commanded that all
seat themselves at a long table, upon which a feast was
spread. After a sumptuous repast, in which "strong
waters, which the savages love only too well," were
served, a treaty was concluded, with the following
terms:</p>

<p>1st. That neither Massasoit nor any of his people
should do any hurt to any of the English.</p>

<p>2d. That if any Indian should injure an Englishman,
the offender would be sent to Plymouth in order that
he might be punished.</p>


<p><a name="a86" id="a86"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%"><a href="images/086.jpg">
<img src="images/086_th.jpg" alt="" style="width: 70%" /></a>
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">SITTING BULL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>3rd. That if anything were stolen from the Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>the Governor of Plymouth would cause it to be returned,
and the Indian would do likewise toward the English.</p>

<p>4th. That if any unjust war were brought against the
Wampanoags, the English would aid them in defeating
their adversaries, and that if anyone unjustly warred
against the English, Massasoit would aid them.</p>

<p>5th. That in case of actual warfare, the English
Governor would send confederates to warn Massasoit
of the fact.</p>

<p>6th. That whenever the English came to the camp of
the Wampanoags, they should leave their arms behind
them.</p>

<p>7th. That if Massasoit should do this, King James of
England would consider him as his perpetual friend
and ally.</p>

<p>This seemed to please the great Sachem greatly, for
he not only agreed to it, but acknowledged King James
of England to be his Sovereign, and gave him all his
adjacent lands for his subjects to live on forever. It
was a treaty upon peaceable and honorable terms; the
Indians came to Plymouth to make it of their own free
will, and, although for all the land which they granted
to the English they received only a pair of knives and a
copper chain with a jewel in it, a pot of "strong water,"
a quantity of biscuit and some butter for Quadepinah&mdash;the
brother of Massasoit&mdash;it is pleasant to know that
this agreement was unbroken for fifty years. Massasoit,
himself, did well to obtain the friendship of the
English, for the powerful tribes of Narragansetts were
his enemies, and they were now afraid to attack his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>camps. The Puritans also benefitted from this agreement,
as they obtained an opportunity for profitable
trade in peace and seclusion.</p>

<p>There were about twenty different tribes in New
England, at this time, and, although mainly independent
of each other, they sometimes united for the purpose
of making war upon a common enemy. The Pequots,
Narragansetts, Pokanokets, Massachusetts, and Pawtuckets
were the more powerful, although the Mohegans,
the Nipmucks, and Abenakis of Maine were also prominent.
The Pequots numbered only about four thousand,
in all, while the Narragansetts of Rhode Island&mdash;with
about one thousand warriors&mdash;were next in point
of numbers. The other tribes were smaller still, so it
can be readily seen that this band of hardy pioneers
could, with their armor and firearms, have competed in
battle with even the most powerful of these, although,
should all have combined against them, their doom
would have been sure. Massasoit's people, the Wampanoags,
were a part of the Massachusetts Indians, and
lived between Plymouth and Narragansett Bay. They
were sometimes called Pokanokets. To the south
they had the Nansets, as neighbors, on Cape Cod; the
Pennacooks, on the northern frontier extending into
New Hampshire; and the Nipmucks in central Massachusetts
extending into Connecticut and Rhode Island.
The Pawtuckets, who had been nearly destroyed by
the great pestilence, were north of the tribes of Massachusetts,
and included the Pennacooks and other small
clans. Massasoit's home was at Mount Hope, where
now stands the town of Bristol, Rhode Island, a seaport
upon the wide waters of Narragansett Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>After the famous treaty between the Wampanoag
Sachem and the English had been drawn and signed,
Massasoit was conducted back to his own people by the
Governor himself. Hostages were left behind and soon
his brother Quadepinah came down the brook with a
retinue of followers. He, too, was well entertained and
so well pleased that, upon the day following, Standish
and Allerton&mdash;two of the more prominent Englishmen&mdash;were
invited to come to the Indian camp, where they
were regaled with three or four groundnuts and some
tobacco. In return for this kind treatment, the Governor
of Plymouth sent for the chief's kettle and returned
it filled to the brim with peas, a vegetable which the
Wampanoags had never before seen. This pleased
Massasoit mightily, and, next morning, he and his entire
retinue returned towards their own homes, with laughter,
smiles and many evidences of good feeling towards the
Puritans.</p>

<p>Squanto&mdash;the only survivor of the tribe of Patuxets
who had originally lived here&mdash;became an intimate and
valued friend of the English. He taught the Puritans
how to plant maize, or Indian corn, and how to enrich
the soil, by spreading over it the remains of alewives&mdash;fish
which ran up the brooks in April to spawn. This
proved a great value to the Colonists, for the wheat and
peas which they had brought from England with them,
turned out to be almost worthless. Later in the year
the Indian guided two ambassadors (Winslow and Hopkins)
across the country to Massasoit's chief village of
Pokanoket (now Warren, Rhode Island), in order that
the treaty of peace which had been made with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
might be confirmed. It was in summer&mdash;a period of
softness and beauty in Massachusetts&mdash;and so the two
Puritans, as they journeyed through the undulating
country, studied its character and soil and became
acquainted with the situation of the neighboring tribes.
Game was plentiful, especially wild turkeys, which
have long since disappeared from the Atlantic Coast,
and those left behind by the hardy emissaries were busy
with fishing, deer hunting, and watching the corn crop.
This grew well, was cut and stored for the winter, and,
with an abundance of dried fish and jerked venison, the
Colonists looked forward to a much better winter than
that of the year previous.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the Narragansett Indians sent a
bundle of arrows tied together with the skin of a rattlesnake
to the Colonists, and&mdash;although these were known
to be most warlike of all the surrounding tribes&mdash;in
token of defiance, the skin was stuffed with powder and
ball, and returned. An attack was now expected and
so a palisade was erected outside the row of huts, but,
although the Narragansetts were evidently at no loss to
understand the meaning of the answer which the Puritans
had sent, they left the settlement alone.</p>

<p>At the first Indian town to which the two ambassadors
came, they were greeted by the Wampanoags with generous
but humble hospitality. The Indians gave them
cold cornbread, fish, and boiled, musty acorns. After
the meal, Winslow shot at a crow with his musket, and,
as he killed it at quite a distance, the natives were
greatly astonished and amused. With a show of true
kindliness, the two Puritans were directed to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Indian town, some eight miles distant, where they
were welcomed by a party who were catching great
numbers of fine bass in the Taunton River, and who not
only gave them a supper but also a breakfast next
morning. Attended by six of their hosts, upon the
following day, they were crossing the river, when two
old Indians upon the opposite bank ran swiftly and
stealthily among the high grasses to meet them, and
then with loud voices and drawn bows demanded who
they were. Seeing that they were friends, their hostility
turned to welcome, and, instead of shooting at
them, the unfriendly braves gave them food. In return
they received a small bracelet of beads. After one other
stop the travelers reached Sowams, or Mount Hope&mdash;the
home of Massasoit.</p>

<p>The great Sachem was not at home, at first, but soon
arrived, to be greeted by the two Englishmen by the
discharge of their muskets. This startled the aged
warrior, but pleased him also, so he welcomed the two
guests with kindness and took them to his lodge. After
seating themselves, the Englishmen delivered to their
host a coat of red cotton heavily embroidered with
fine lace, and a long chain of copper and beads. The
chief immediately put this on&mdash;much to the astonishment
of the Wampanoags&mdash;who gazed at him from a
respectful distance with awe and unspeakable admiration,
as he listened to the message from the English
governor. This was to the effect that the Puritans
trusted that the peace which so far existed between
them should be continued, and that, as Massasoit's
people (particularly his women and children) came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
frequently to Plymouth and were always most welcome,
the Colonists feared that their corn would be insufficient
in the future to give them proper entertainment. So
the Governor requested that Massasoit would not be
angered, if, in the next months, the Colonists did not
feed his Indians as sumptuously as heretofore, when
they came to them upon a visit. But if Massasoit himself
should come to Plymouth, or any friend of his, he
would be welcome and most hospitably received.
"Furthermore," said Winslow, in closing, "I trust that
the Pokanokets, who have furs, shall be permitted to
sell them to us, for we can send them to our brothers in
England, in exchange for many things which we need in
the colony."</p>

<p>"I hear the good speech of my English brother," said
Massasoit, "and it pleases me much to see them with me.
You ask me to keep my people from Plymouth until you
know the abundance of your harvest. That I will do,
for do not I command all the country about you? Are
not all the towns about here of my dominions and the
people in them? And, if I shall tell them to bring me
their skins, that they will do. I have thirty settlements
which I rule over, and they shall do as I command."</p>

<p>"Thank you, good chief," replied Winslow. "I am
sure that what you say shall be followed out. Now let
us smoke the pipe of peace and further cement our
friendship."</p>

<p>To this the friendly chief seemed to be agreeable, but,
after the pipe had been passed around, it was seen that
the hour was late, and consequently Massasoit offered
the two ambassadors a bed in his own cabin. He and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
his wife slept at one end upon a plank platform, raised
a foot or two from the ground and covered with a thin
mat, and the Englishmen were requested to find a sleeping
place upon the other end. This they did, but so hard
was the flooring, and so vicious were the Rhode Island
mosquitoes that both scarce slept at all, particularly
as two Indians, whom the Sachem had placed outside
as a bodyguard, walked up and down during the entire
evening, vigorously slapping at the buzzing insects and
making such a noise that it was impossible not to be
kept wide awake.</p>

<p>Finally morning dawned, and the two unhappy men
were soon breakfasting on cornbread and boiled water,
while numerous Indians began to stream into camp from
neighboring settlements. By noon a goodly number
had arrived, and Massasoit&mdash;with true hospitality&mdash;made
them all seat themselves and partake of a meal of
boiled fish, which he himself had speared with arrows
as they swam in the Taunton River. Afterwards the
savages held a running race and other games, until the
descending sun warned them that evening was approaching.
Then with many grunts, smiles, and protestations
of affection, the visiting braves departed to their own
homes. The two Englishmen also begged to be excused,
as the barbarous singing of the Indians at night,
coupled with the buzzing and stings of mosquitoes,
made them long for quiet Plymouth where netting of
twine was stretched over the windows to keep out the
pests. So they also said adieu to kind-hearted Massasoit,
who bade them a warm and tender farewell.</p>

<p>In March, 1622, an incident occurred which came near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
putting an end to this strong friendship between the
Wampanoag Sachem and the English, for an Indian
came rushing breathlessly in among a party of Colonists,
with his face gashed and the blood running from it,
calling out to them to run quickly to shelter, as his
countrymen were on the warpath. They eagerly
questioned him, and were told that the savages, under
Massasoit, were congregating at a certain place in order
to make an attack upon the colony and that he had been
wounded by them because he had opposed their base
designs. Immediately the Puritans ran to arms and
prepared for a stout defense of Plymouth, although a
Pokanoket Indian named Hobbammak, who made his
home with the Colonists, stoutly denied that the fugitive
had spoken the truth. "Send you to Sowams, the home
of Massasoit," said he, "and you will soon find that this
story is false. I know that Squanto has caused this man
to run to you, thus."</p>

<p>"This I will do," said the Governor, and forthwith
dispatched a messenger to the Sachem's residence, who
arrived only to find that everything was in its accustomed
condition of peace and tranquility. He consequently
told Massasoit of the reports circulated against him,
which enraged the good Sachem tremendously and caused
him to utter many uncomplimentary remarks about
Squanto, whom&mdash;it was understood&mdash;had instigated
the action of the Indian out of a spirit of malicious mischief.
"Let me but catch this Squanto," shouted
Massasoit, "and I will teach him not to meddle with
my own private affairs. But go tell the Governor of
Plymouth," he continued, "that I am glad to hear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
he himself has not believed the idle talk of this lying
Indian. Tell him that, if any conspiracy against him
ever does take place, I myself will be the first to send
him word of it." And with these declarations of strict
friendship and integrity ringing in his ears, the messenger
returned to Plymouth and quickly quieted the
fears of the waiting Colonists.</p>

<p>Squanto died in November on an expedition fitted
out by Governor Bradford for obtaining corn from the
Indians, and so perished the last aboriginal of the
Plymouth soil. He had been serviceable to the English,
but quite anxious to have credit for that fact among his
own countrymen, and on one occasion amused himself
by telling his own people that the whites kept the plague
pent up in their cellars, and that they intended to make
war upon various tribes. This was done in order that
they would employ him to mediate between them and
the English for a certain sum, and, of course, when so
hired, he always succeeded in settling the difficulty.</p>

<p>As for Massasoit, his friendship for the English continued,
for no attacks were made upon the settlement
during the entire winter. Early in the spring of that
year (1623), a runner came in from his settlement bearing
the news that the great Sachem lay dangerously ill
at Sowams, and begged that someone who had medical
knowledge would come to his assistance: a fact which
showed that he put great faith in the superior intellect
and attainments of the English. So Edward Winslow
was sent to visit him, as a token of the friendship of the
Colonists, and he was accompanied by another English
gentleman&mdash;a Mr. John Hampden&mdash;who had some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
knowledge of medicine&mdash;who brought with him some
cordials and other alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p>The two Englishmen had gone but a short journey,
when an Indian met them who had tears in his eyes.
"Massasoit is dead," said he. "The great chief has gone
to the happy hunting grounds." At this, the Indian
guide named Hobbammak, whom they had with them
as guide and interpreter, began to wail a death song.
"O Great Sachem, O Great Heart, with many have I
been acquainted," he cried, "but none ever equaled
him. His like, oh, Master Winslow, you shall never see
again, for he was not false, bloody, and unpeaceable like
other Indians, but kind, easily appeased when angry, and
most reasonable in his requirements. He was a wise
Sachem, not ashamed to ask advice, and governed better
with mild measures than other chiefs did with severe
ones. I fear, now that he is dead, that you have not one
faithful friend left in the wigwams of the red men."</p>

<p>"Time presses, Hobbammak," said Winslow. "Leave
off wringing your hands and your loud lamentations.
We must trudge along, and hasten to the tepee of Massasoit,
for he may not now be dead and these stories may
be false."</p>

<p>So saying, they hastened on through the forest and
soon came to a village of a sub-chief called Corbetant,
who was not at home. But his squaw came running to
meet the white men, crying: "Hasten, hasten, Massasoit
is not yet dead, but if you run quickly you will
arrive in time to breathe a prayer over his body."</p>

<p>The two Englishmen redoubled their speed, and soon
arrived at Massasoit's village, where they found the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Sachem's house so full of his followers that they could
scarcely get inside. The Indians were making a "fiendish
noise," while about the prostrate body of the chief were
six or eight women who chafed his arms, legs, and thighs
to keep the heat in them. But&mdash;seeing Winslow and
Hampden in the doorway&mdash;one of them cried out,
"The English have come, O chief. Here are two of the
white men!"</p>

<p>Massasoit endeavored to look in their direction, but
his sight was wholly gone and he could see nothing.</p>

<p>"Who has come?" said he.</p>

<p>"Winsnow has come," said one of the Indians, who
called the Englishman by the name he was known by
among the Wampanoags.</p>

<p>"Let me speak with him, then. Let me speak one
word with him," muttered the great Sachem.</p>

<p>Winslow stepped forward to the matted platform
where he lay, and grasped the feeble hand which the
emasculated Indian held out to him.</p>

<p>"Art thou Winsnow?" whispered Massasoit. "Art
thou, indeed, Winsnow? O Winsnow, I shall never
see thee again, for I go to the Great Spirit&mdash;to the land
of the Hereafter."</p>

<p>"I do not think that thee will die," said Winslow
soothingly. "Here, Hobbammak, bring me the cordials
which I have transported hither for the good King of
the Wampanoags!" And as the guide presented them
to him, he soon poured some liquid into a cup and gave
it to the weakened Sachem. The effect was immediate.
With several more drafts, the chief began to show signs
of renewed strength, and, after he had lain quietly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
an hour, he was so much improved that his eyesight
began to return.</p>

<p>"Now I know that the English are my friends," cried
Massasoit. "Now I know that they love me, and while
I live I will not ever forget this kindness, and here, good
Winsnow, bring me some English pottage from a roasted
fowl, as I have seen you English make at Plymouth, and
I shall grow entirely well."</p>

<p>This was done for him, and so much other care administered
to the sinking chieftain that his strength
and appetite were wonderfully restored. In two days'
time he was up and about, while his attendants showered
Winslow and Hampden with expressions of gratitude.
Meanwhile the fame of the kindly Winslow, as a
physician, spread so rapidly that crowds gathered in an
encampment around Montaup, in order to have him
prescribe for their various ills. Some, indeed, came
from a distance of from sixty to a hundred miles, and
the readymade physician might have remained with
them indefinitely, had not rumors of a conspiracy among
the Pokanokets and other Indians of Massachusetts
against the settlement of Plymouth soon decided the
two wayfarers to return. Information of their plot was
told to Hobbammak by Massasoit, who said that he,
himself, had been invited to join in it. "A chief was
here at the setting of the sun," said he, "and he told
me that the palefaces did not love me, else they would
visit me in my pain, and he urged me to join their war
party. But I said no. Now, Hobbammak, go tell
Winsnow to take the chiefs of this league and kill them,
and it will end the war-trail in the blood of those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
made it, and will save the inhabitants of the settlement."
This advice was afterwards taken by Miles
Standish and his men, who, with little difficulty, captured
and put to death the very Indians who had plotted
against the peaceful Puritans. But Winslow and
Hampden, thinking that their presence would be of
far more value at Plymouth than at Sowams, quickly
bade adieu to the aged chieftain and were soon hastening
towards the unprotected settlement upon the seacoast
which they had left behind them.</p>

<p>Nine years after this the Narragansetts went upon
the warpath against Massasoit, and attacked him so
vigorously at Sowams that he was obliged to take refuge
in the wooden house which an Englishman had erected
near by. Here he held the enemy at bay, while one of
his own braves bore news of his predicament to the
English at Plymouth, who immediately sent an armed
force to his relief under the command of Miles Standish.
The Narragansetts had learned to fear the guns of the
Puritans, at their cost, so, at the approach of the white
troops, they quickly made off into the woods. With
joy and many tokens of gratitude, the Sachem of the
Wampanoags welcomed this deliverance and showered
presents and deerskins upon the rescuing white men.</p>

<p>The friendship of this famous chieftain was further
shown the English, when&mdash;during a period of great
religious controversy&mdash;he gave a welcome shelter to
Roger Williams, a young Welsh, dissenting minister,
who was forced to leave the Puritan Colonists, because
of differences with them in respect to their religious
beliefs. Williams had come to Massachusetts in 1631,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and had settled at Salem, where a struggling band of
Puritans had started a settlement. Here he soon came
into disfavor because he considered that the strict laws
regulating the doctrine and worship of the Puritans
were too narrow, and openly preached against the teachings
of those who guided the spiritual welfare of the
Colonists. Several times he was told to appear before
the magistrates, and at last the general court, or legislature
of the colony of Massachusetts, pronounced the
sentence of exile upon him, because he had taught
doctrines which "subverted the fundamental state and
government." It was determined to dispatch him to
the mother country upon a ship which was soon to leave
for England, but someone told the bold minister of this,
so he escaped from his house in Salem, in January, 1636,
and, after wandering half starved and half chilled for
fourteen weeks in the dense forest, he finally reached
Plymouth. Here&mdash;with a few friends&mdash;he determined
to make a settlement and begin his life afresh. But
now Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts wrote to him&mdash;because
he believed him to have been badly treated
by the Colonists&mdash;and advised him to make a home
somewhere on Narragansett Bay, and beyond the territory
claimed by the other Colonists&mdash;advice which
Williams had the good sense to adopt. So with five
companions, in June, 1636, he paddled into the Seekonk,
or Blackstone River, in a canoe, and landed at the head
of Narragansett Bay, where he founded the city of
Providence&mdash;so called because of his belief that he had
found it only by divine guidance.</p>

<p>This land had been given to him by Massasoit, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
whom he had found a refuge at Mount Hope during
his wanderings in the wilderness, and who had fed and
housed him during the black storms of winter. The
old chief had showed him every care and attention,
and had the greatest friendship for this noble-hearted
man of God, who had not only written an essay upon
the rights of the Indians to the American soil, which
had made him many enemies among the Colonists (because
they considered it an attack upon the King of
England), but who had a real regard for the savages.
It is said that love begets love, and so it would seem
with Roger Williams and the Wampanoags. The
Colony of Providence prospered; each year brought it
additional settlers; and, protected from the attacks
of savages by their friendship and high regard, the
little town soon grew in strength and prominence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pleasantest picture that we have of this
friendly Chief of the Wampanoags is that presented
by the first Thanksgiving ceremony held by the Puritan
fathers, in the autumn of 1621. After grave and
serious struggles with starvation and disease, the time
came when the white settlers had an abundance, not only
for the present need, but also for the future. Their
corn crop had been ample, pumpkins and fat squashes
ripened upon their vines, and a quantity of codfish
had been caught and dried upon the beach. With
houses now tight plastered against the blasts of the elements,
and with a stout palisade to repel the attacks
of any savages who might take the warpath against
them, they waited for the cold snows of winter with
none of the dread which had before consumed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
spirits. So they prepared a great feast of Thanksgiving,
and to it invited Massasoit&mdash;their friend and ally&mdash;who,
in deerskin and feathers, came with several of his
tribe to the festival of rejoicing. With grunts of contentment
the Wampanoags feasted upon the supplies
of the Puritans, who, laying aside their arms and armor,
mingled with the red men upon terms of the greatest
freedom and still further cemented the bonds of peace
and good-will which already existed between them.</p>

<p>Later on, the kindly disposed chieftain apparently
associated his eldest son with him in the government of
his small tribes, for together they came to Plymouth
and requested that the Puritan fathers allow the ancient
treaty between them to remain as it originally had been
drawn up by the head men of the two races. So, too,
their names are often found together upon deeds of
conveyance of land to the English. In 1649, Massasoit
had apparently less need of his possessions than he did
of money, for he sold the territory of Bridgewater to the
Plymouth Colonists, and took in payment seven coats
and a half of a coat, nine hatchets, eight hoes, twenty
knives, four moose skins, and ten yards of cotton&mdash;a
small recompense indeed for such a large amount of
territory disposed of, and one which must have been
quickly used up. But he was a mere savage whose
wants were few, and, with no regard for the future, or
realization of the tremendous numbers of whites who
were soon to invade the land about him, he doubtless
believed that his people would have land and country
enough to last them forever. In 1653, another deed was
made out by him, conveying a part of the territory of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Swansea to English grantees, and, as another record&mdash;in
which his name appears&mdash;is in 1661, it is apparent that
he was alive as late as this and still disposing of his ancestral
holdings. But this is the last trace of the great
chief which has been left to posterity, so it is evident
that the kind-hearted and peaceable Massasoit&mdash;the true
friend of the Puritans&mdash;died about this time. He must
have been at least eighty years of age, and was beloved,
respected and admired by both his own people and those
who would have been his bitterest foes had he shown
himself to be possessed of the same vindictive cruelty
and hatred as other Indian chiefs.</p>

<p>The fact that this eminent red man was beloved as
well as respected by his subjects and Indian neighbors,
far and wide, is well shown by the fact that a great concourse
of anxious friends flocked about him during the
illness from which he was restored by good Winslow.
"Some," says this Englishman, "came from more than
one hundred miles for the purpose of seeing the great
Massasoit before his death, and they all watched him with
as much anxiety as if he had been their blood relation.
That morning when he had partly recovered, he told me
to spend my time in going from one to another, in the
town of Sowams, requesting me to treat them as I had
him, and to give to each of them some of the same
medicine that I had given to him, for they were good
folks." It is only too apparent, then, that he won the
regard of his own race by his kindness, for even though
he himself was near death, his first thought, upon his
recovery, was for those about him who were ill and in
distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>His wealth and residence were no better than the
meanest of his tribe; it is known that, with the exception
of an ornament of bones around his neck, he was no more
luxuriously dressed than the poorest of his subjects, yet
the dignity and energy of his character was such that
he controlled their wild passions and hatred for the
whites, because of their personal confidence and affection
in him. The authority of Chief Sachem was the free
gift of the Indians and could have been taken away at
any moment from him by the general vote of the people
whom he ruled, but, never, during his long life, was
such an act contemplated or apparently desired. As he
must have been nearly eighty years of age at the time
of his death, his rule of the barbarous and savage tribes
was an extremely long one, and such was his influence
for peace, that, during his life, there was scarcely an
instance of an individual broil or quarrel with the
English. Some of the Pokanokets&mdash;the Sachem Corbetant,
in particular&mdash;were extremely hostile to the Puritans,
even contemplating an attack upon Plymouth, and,
although this warrior openly defied them, and fought
them, upon one occasion, he was subsequently overcome
with remorse and solicited the good offices of
Massasoit to reconcile him with the English. Such
was the great Sachem's influence over all the Massachusetts
Chieftains that nine of them went to Plymouth,
at his request, and made overtures of peace to the
English, telling them that they recognized their possession
to the land, and their authority to the perpetual
holding of it.</p>

<p>Massasoit, the Good, was not distinguished as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
warrior, and he is not known to have ever been engaged
in any open hostilities with the unfriendly tribes about
him. It is, therefore, surprising that he could have
held the respect of the people, whose chief regard is for
those who excel in warfare. For forty-five years he was
at peace with the whites, and thus kept his tribe from
the fate which befell every Indian tribe in New England,
which warred with the men of another race&mdash;they succumbed
to the superior ability of the men with muskets
and ball. All the native nations of New England save
his were, for many years, involved in dissensions and
wars, not only with the whites, but among themselves,
and the Pequots, the savages of Maine, the Narragansetts
and the Mohegans continually fought and reduced
their strength as if their only desire was to exterminate
the Indian race and prepare ample room for the whites.
"I <i>know</i> that the English love me&mdash;I love them&mdash;I shall
never forget them," said the great Wampanoag to
Winslow, after his first recovery from the severe sickness
from which that amiable Englishman effected a cure,
and thus, beloved by his own people and by those who
would have been bitter enemies, had they been treated
differently, the spirit of this kindly savage hovers over
the dim pages of early Massachusetts history, as a bright
and lustrous spark amid the gloomy reminiscences of

<h2>KING PHILIP, OR METACOMET</h2>


<p>One day old Massasoit came to the settlement at
Plymouth bringing with him two brown and
sturdy Indian youths, and, taking them to the
Governor's house, he said, with a great show of good
will:</p>

<p>"These are my two sons. You English make fine
names. Better names than Indian make. Ugh! Ugh!
You give white name to my children."</p>

<p>"It shall be as you say," replied the obliging Governor,
as he gazed with much admiration at the two little
Wampanoags. "I shall call one Alexander, after
Alexander the Great, and the other Philip, after the other
Grecian conqueror who bore that name in ancient
history."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh! It is well!" said Massasoit, and, after
smoking a pipe of peace with his friend, the Englishman,
he returned to his quiet life at Mount Hope.</p>

</div>

<p>Alexander&mdash;the elder of the two sons&mdash;ruled over the
destinies of his race after the peaceful death of his father,
but, as he grew in strength and intelligence, he saw the
white men increasing in the land of his ancestors, like
locusts in the hot summer. Ship after ship came over
from England bringing cargoes of supplies and eager
men, anxious to obtain a foothold in the new country
and build a home in the wilderness. Plymouth became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>a good-sized settlement, Boston a flourishing port,
Salem a trading place from which ships sailed as far as
the West Indies; while at Deerfield, Northampton,
and Hadley&mdash;far in the interior of Massachusetts&mdash;clusters
of log cabins and clapboarded houses dotted
the clearings.</p>

<p>The white men became more and more eager to
possess the land of the Indians; more greedy for farms;
more harsh to the lazy, dreamy savages who cared not
for houses, for cattle, or for the luxuries of the whites;
but preferred their own simple life, the pleasures of hunting
and fishing, and their smoky, drafty wigwams.
They were always at leisure, all of their surroundings
had been free to them before the advent of the Puritans,
their wants were few, and were easily supplied. Now,
clearings and farms began to spoil the once trackless
forests; where once they could roam at will, now those
of another race had sown their corn and forbade them
to hunt and fish in the streams near by. The silent
woods echoed with the axe and saw of the toiling,
energetic men from a far distant land, and the Indian
began to reflect upon the future when all of his hunting
grounds would vanish and he would have to move
farther inland, among the warlike Mohawks, if he
wished to live amidst the silence of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Wetamoo, a wealthy Indian Princess, became the
bride of Alexander, and as she had many followers and
much wampum, the oldest son of Massasoit became a
man of as much prominence as his father had been
before him. His wealth made him arrogant, and stories
came to the ears of the settlers at Plymouth that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
plotting, with the Narragansetts, to openly revolt against
them and begin a war with those with whom his father
had been so friendly. Whether these stories were true,
or not, it is difficult to say; at any rate the Puritans
believed them, and so summoned him to attend the court
at Plymouth and clear himself of suspicion. He refused
to pay any attention to these commands. Major
Winslow was, therefore, ordered to go to Mount Hope
and arrest him with the aid of ten well-armed soldiers
who were to add to their number as they proceeded
through the settlements which lay between. He had
gone but a short way when he came upon the Wampanoag
chief in a hunting-lodge. Within were eight
or ten warriors, all armed; but the whites secured
their guns, and entering the house, clapped a pistol
to the breast of Alexander, telling him that if he stirred
or refused to go, he was a dead man.</p>

<p>The proud Sachem was outraged at this treatment
and violently upbraided the Colonel who had taken him;
declaring with passion that the Governor had no right
to believe the idle rumors which came to his ears from
lying savages, and that he would not stir. But the cold
steel of the pistol at his chest was reflected in the eye of
the soldier who held it. The Indian had no choice, and,
when his first anger had subsided, he went along moodily
and in great dejection, with his attendants following in
the rear. A kind soldier offered him a horse, but he said
that he could walk as well as any squaw, and so proceeded
to Marshfield, where the night was spent. In the
morning a high fever raged in his veins. He was
violently ill&mdash;so ill that it was thought best not to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
him by the physicians of the town, but when he plead
that he be allowed to go home, stern Winslow consented.
He was released, on giving his parole to return
when next summoned, and so, borne on a litter by his
faithful men, he left his captors for his own abode.
His retainers had not carried him far before he died,
amidst the lamentations of those about him and the
wailings of his squaw Wetamoo, who declared that the
English had poisoned her brave husband.</p>

<p>Thus Philip, or Metacomet&mdash;the second son of Massasoit&mdash;came
to be chief of the Wampanoags. He was
about twenty-three years of age, tall, strong, handsome,
and with a spirit as proud and haughty as that of his
departed brother, who was so sensitive that he had
perished as a result of his own injured dignity. Had
the English been kind and conciliatory to the new
Wampanoag chieftain, they might have gained his
friendship instead of his ill will, but the continual
nagging which they subjected him to increased his
resentment against them and nurtured in him a sullen
distrust of all white men and those connected with them.
One of the new chief's earliest measures was to come to
Plymouth and appear before the court, thus following
the example of his father and his brother, for he pledged
himself to use every effort to continue the peace which
had always existed between the Colonists and those of
his own race. For several years after this, the intercourse
between the settlers and Indians went on as before,
but deep in the hearts of both the red men and
whites was a growing suspicion and distrust, which
finally came to a point in 1671, when Philip openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
made complaint of the encroachment of the English
upon his hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>Rumors came thick and fast to the men of Plymouth
that the savages were contemplating war, that they
were oiling their guns, which they had purchased from
the traders, and were sharpening their hatchets. The
Plymouth Government was alarmed. "The Indians
are impertinent in their bearings towards all Englishmen,"
wrote a prominent settler to the Governor, and
so that officer of the crown sent word to Philip that he
wished to see him and hold a conference with him at
Taunton. At first the proud chief refused to come to
meet the English, but he apparently changed his intentions,
for on April 10th, 1671, a message was received
from him, inviting the officers of the Plymouth Government
to meet him in a "pow-wow," but demanding
that two hostages should be sent him as a guarantee of
his own safety. When these were received, he came
to Taunton with many followers, and, seeing military
preparations among the English in the town, took up
a position upon the outskirts, near a mill, and refused
to move from this ground until three commissioners sent
from Massachusetts came out to meet him, and persuaded
the now unfriendly chief that no harm would
be done him if he came to greet the Governor. So, with
glances of suspicion and distrust, the Indians entered
the church where was the Governor, surrounded by
soldiers in slouch hats with broad brims, long swords,
iron breastplates and unwieldy guns. The followers
of King Philip were naked to the waist, had their faces
and bodies painted in many colors, and were, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
most part, armed with long bows and with quivers full
of arrows, although a few who knew how to use them
had guns in their hands.</p>

<p>"I charge you with warlike designs against us," said
Governor Prince. "Many have told me that you and
yours prepare for open hostility against the English."</p>

<p>In the dark eyes of Philip gleamed the fire of intense
anger, as he replied:</p>

<p>"It is an untruth. I have sharpened my hatchets
and arrows because I feared an attack by the Narragansetts,
who are unfriendly to me and mine." As
he spoke, the looks of defiance which his warriors cast
at the English showed that if the soldiers should dare to
lay a hand upon their chieftain, there would be certain
bloodshed.</p>

<p>A long talk was now held, and, in the end, the defiant
Sachem agreed to renew the old peace covenant between
himself and the English, and to surrender all firearms into
their hands as long as there was any suspicion of war
upon their part. But he had no intentions of doing
this and of thus placing himself at the mercy of the
English, nor could he have forced his warriors to do so
had he so wished, for the Indians had come into possession
of large numbers of muskets which they used for
killing game, and which they considered as much a
necessity as their own clothes. Thus, although the conference
ended in peace, the English soon took measures
to enforce the compliance with its terms and so awakened
intense hatred and anger in the hearts of King
Philip's men. The guns of the Assowomsett and
Middleboro Indians were seized by force; the Saconet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
braves were threatened with war if they refused to deliver
up their firearms, and, as in September only seventy
guns had been handed in to the Plymouth authorities,
they again summoned proud Philip to appear before
them and to give the reason why his men did not live up
to their agreement. He did not appear before them until
he was fully prepared to answer the accusations.</p>

<p>The charges against the Wampanoag Sachem were
that he had neglected to bring in his arms; that he had
refused to come to the English court when sent for;
that he had harbored bad Indians; had been insolent
to the Massachusetts magistrates, and had misrepresented
matters to them. To these accusations he replied
that he was as much a subject of the King of
England as were the Plymouth Colonists themselves,
which was true; that as he was a subject of the King he
was not obliged to run at the beck and call of the Colonists,
for they were only subjects as he himself was; and
that he was unable to make his men give up their guns
as they needed them for supplying themselves with
deer meat and wild turkeys. His arguments were good,
but he could not convince the hard-fisted magistrates
of the righteousness of his cause.</p>

<p>"You must sign a new treaty with us," said stern
Governor Prince. "And you must agree to pay tribute
of one thousand English dollars every year in fur and
peltries. Also bring us five wolves' heads a year and do
not engage in war with other tribes, or sell your lands
to others, without consulting first the Plymouth Council.
As for delivering the guns to us, this you need not do,
as you say that your warriors need them for obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
game in order to live by, but, if you further insult our
white ambassadors you must expect to smart for it."</p>

<p>"How! How!" muttered King Philip, as he withdrew.
"Ugh! You English want everything your
way, but it shall be as you say."</p>

<p>So, turning his face towards Mount Hope, he had
soon disappeared into the forest and only the sighing of
the wind in the pine branches came to the ears of the
relentless counsellors, who, sure of their strength and
resources, had begun to use force upon the weaker and
less energetic race. They watched his retreating form
with frowns of determination upon their brows.</p>

<p>For three years peace reigned in the forest. The
Narragansetts, Wampanoags, and Nipmucks resigned
themselves to the inevitable domination of the English,
but hunters and trappers told of the sullen manner
of the independent Indians and of the lack of stockades
at the far distant towns of the interior. The great body
of Colonists went upon their way in fancied peace and
security, tilled the soil, cut down the trees of the forests,
and broke new roads through the wilderness with no
thought of danger. So low was the interest in the
Provincial militia that no elections for military officers
were held by the people and their officers were appointed
by the general court. But suddenly an episode occurred
which woke the slumbering spirit of war and
again fired the angry passions of both red men and white.
This was a murder.</p>

<p>There had been living among the Wampanoags at
Nemasket, an Indian converted to Christianity by John
Eliot, a Puritan missionary. This savage was named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Sassamon, a cunning and plausible fellow, who accompanied
King Philip to the last conference with the
Governor, as an interpreter. He was close to Philip,
was in his confidence, and hearing him speak often of a
desire to go to war against the English, he one day
journeyed to Plymouth, and told the people there to
be on their guard, for the Wampanoag chief was determined
to massacre them if he had a favorable opportunity.
This alarming news was not believed by
Governor Prince, "for," said he, "all Indians are, by
nature, untruthful and wish to make you fear them."
So the Puritans paid little heed to this information,
especially as Philip, himself, soon came to the settlement,
declaring that he wished for peace; that he had
heard of Sassamon's talk; and that he wanted to tell
them that such sayings were untruthful and absurd.</p>

<p>Today a few survivors of the Nemasket tribe of
Indians live upon the edge of Assowomset Pond, four
miles south of the village of Middleborough, Massachusetts,
and on the surface of this quiet sheet of water
was found floating the body of Sassamon, in the spring
of the year. Bruises upon his body aroused the suspicions
of the whites, who came to the belief that he had
been killed during the winter and his remains thrown
beneath the surface of the pond, in revenge for his
treacherous talk. Three Indians were arrested on suspicion,
but they claimed that Sassamon had been
drowned while fishing and that the marks upon his body
were caused by contact with the ice. In spite of this, they
were called before a jury of whites and Indians, and,
upon the evidence of an Indian who claimed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
was an eye witness of the affair, were sentenced to be
hung. The last red man to swing for the crime confessed
that the other Wampanoags had really murdered the
red man and that he had been a looker-on, but not a
participator in the deed. In spite of thus turning
"States Evidence" he was first reprieved and then
executed, and, although there was no actual proof of
King Philip's connection with this terrible affair, it was
evident that he had decreed that Sassamon should die
as a fit punishment for his tale-bearing to the English
settlement.</p>

<p>The execution of the three Indians aroused the angry
passions of the Wampanoags to fever heat and they
soon began to annoy the white settlers who had the
misfortune to live in the neighborhood of Mount Hope.
The peaceful folk at Plymouth now had rumors of ravage
and excesses of all kinds. Houses were robbed while
the men were in the fields at work; cattle were shot when
they were beyond the hearing of the farmers' wives;
corn was stolen; outbuildings were set on fire in the
night, and sheep were mysteriously slaughtered. A
Christian Indian came, one day, to Governor Prince,
and said: "Strange warriors swarm to King Philip's
village. His women and children are being sent to the
Narragansetts. He and his men are thick as flies, and
they are armed and ready for a long war." Alarm and
terror spread among the far-distant settlements, and
some persons of imaginative minds saw comets in the
form of blazing arrows shoot across the skies, while the
thunder of hoofs of invisible horsemen, and the whistle
of unseen bullets, were heard upon the still air as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
peace-loving villagers walked to and from their meeting-houses.
"To arms! To arms!" was the cry, as the rumors
of the Indian uprising grew more and more frequent,
and the stern-faced Puritans oiled their Cromwellian
muskets, cleaned out the fuse pans, and set their wives
busily to work moulding leaden bullets. War&mdash;cruel,
savage, relentless war, was soon to burst upon the white
settlers of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.</p>

<p>And, as we look upon the events which led up to this
conflict, we see that King Philip and his men had good
reason to make one desperate attempt to rid the country
of the superior race of whites. "What can we do
against you English?" Philip had said in a conference
at Bristol Neck. "If we surrender our arms to you,
you do not deliver them back to us without charging
us a fine; you take our land away from us and pay us
practically nothing. You cheat us whenever we have
dealings with you. As we have no fences around our
cornfields, your horses and cattle trample out our food.
You sell our men liquor, get them drunk, and then, when
they hurt the sober Indians and your cattle, you fine
us so heavily that we must needs sell our land to pay
it. When you English first came to our country, my
father Massasoit was a great man, and you white men
were weak and poor. He gave you more land than I now
possess. Yet you seized upon my brother Alexander,
forced him to come to you with a loaded pistol, and killed
him by your cruel treatment. You will not believe the
testimony of our brothers in your court, and every
lying white man's tale against us is credited."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>These accusations were all true; the English had
crowded the men of a different race and manner of
living back into the interior, and, desiring their land,
had cheated, browbeaten and robbed them of their
possessions with a supreme contempt for their feelings.
To compete with the Puritans, the Wampanoags had to
adopt their ways, but they were content with their own
manner of living; were satisfied with their wigwams
and primitive method of tilling the soil, and did not
want the care or trouble of tending to flocks of sheep
and herds of cattle, which made the white man rich and
prosperous. It was the stronger race against the
weaker, and, as has always happened, the Indians had
to give way to those of greater intelligence and thrift.</p>

<p>Philip was driven to bay and forced into a fight by the
passions which he was unable to control, yet he must
have known that he could not win. The Narragansetts
had not joined him. The surrounding tribes gave him
little assurance that they would fight with him to the
bitter end, and, although tradition has it that the Indians
had seven or eight thousand fighting men, it is
probable that their actual numbers were about three
thousand five hundred. No general conspiracy had been
organized, and, although many individual Indians were
sure to join with Philip's warriors, he could count upon
no assistance save that of his own followers. So the
hostilities began with the odds decidedly against the
native Americans.</p>

<p>The little village of Swansea, Massachusetts, was not
far from the Wampanoag capital of Mount Hope, and
here on Sunday, June the 20th, 1675, a war party of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
eight Indians crept stealthily into the quiet street as
the settlers were at church. They entered a house, upturned
tables, chairs, and bedsteads; stuck arrows
through the pictures, and then killed some peaceful
cows grazing on the village common. But an old man
and his son were at home, and, as they saw the thieving
savages issuing from a neighbor's house, the father
seized his musket and told his boy to "shoot a robbing
varmint." Putting the gun to his shoulder the young
man fired from a window, dropped a savage with the
first bullet, and turned around smiling, when the Indian
crawled to his feet and made off. Later in the day some
friendly Indians came to the village and asked why the
brave had been shot. "Because he was a robber," replied
the old man. "Is he dead?" "Yea," was the
answer. "That is good," shouted the boy who had
pulled the trigger, and, from the looks of hate upon the
faces of the visitors, it could be seen that they were
maddened by the young man's idle words.</p>

<p>Messengers were sent in haste to Plymouth, troops
were ordered to march to Taunton, and, at the same
time, the next Sunday was appointed as a solemn one
for prayer and the chanting of psalms, with the request
that war be turned aside. But these supplications to
heaven were to be of no avail, for, as the settlers of
Swansea returned from their meeting house upon the
next Lord's day, suddenly the wild warwhoops of the
savages and crack of rifles was heard from the depths of
the woods, on either side of the path. One Puritan soon
lay dead upon the ground, another was badly wounded
through the body, and two young men who were running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
back to the village for a large gun, were found dying in
the road, as the fleeing settlers came slowly towards
their homes, with faces towards the lurking foe and
their few muskets speaking loudly in answer to the wild
whoops of the painted braves. Barricading themselves
in the strongest farmhouses, they fought a desultory
battle all through the day, but next morn six persons
were found dead in an outlying log house, which was
farther from the protection of the village. Their heads
were scalped and their bodies had been brutally disfigured.</p>

<p>There were forty thousand English in New England,
and, at the first news of this tragedy, men donned their
armor, seized their guns, and soon were marching in
numbers towards the scene of hostilities. The Praying
Indians&mdash;those converted by the English missionaries&mdash;refused
to join with King Philip's men and either did not
fight at all, or marched with the whites. The Pequots
and Mohegans of Connecticut would not take the field
against the Colonists, for the war had broken out a year
before King Philip had intended it to, and he had not
had time to persuade these to become his allies. He,
himself, is said to have wept, as the tidings of these first
outrages of the war were brought him, for, savage as
he was, he no doubt relented at the idea of disturbing
the long peace which his father&mdash;the good Massasoit&mdash;had
preserved with the Puritans. But the die was cast;
from now on there was to be no rest for the Indian
Sachem; and, although he must have known that, in the
end, he would surely be defeated, he plunged into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>campaign with a brave resolution to conquer the oppressors
of his people. His own following consisted
of six hundred warriors, eager and ready for the fray.
The Narragansetts were willing to assist, the Nipmucks
and the Indians residing upon the Connecticut River
were prepared for a long war, and all the Indians upon
the coast of Maine, fully two hundred miles away,
were soon engaged in the common cause of the race&mdash;the
extermination of the whites. Tradition has it that
between seven and eight thousand fighting men were
enrolled in the war under the leadership of Philip, but,
in reality, there were probably about thirty-five hundred.</p>

<p>On June 20th, a panting messenger came into Plymouth
upon a blown and winded horse.</p>

<p>"Arm! Arm!" he cried to the settlers. "The house
of John Winslow at Swansea has been plundered by the
Indians and many houses have been burned while the
people had been at church. War is begun and we must
defend ourselves to the last ditch."</p>

<p>A stalwart Captain&mdash;a carpenter by trade, and Church
by name&mdash;was one of the first to bear the dreadful
news.</p>

<p>"To arms!" he shouted, as he ran to the house where
muskets and balls were kept. "We'll soon show King
Philip's men that the Puritans can fight as well as they
can hoe corn." And, before two houses were passed,
twenty horsemen galloped down the main street in the
direction of Taunton; their swords gleaming in the
bright sun, and their breastplates flashing like the
saucepans in the kitchens of the good housewives.</p>

<p>Church was a stout soldier and as ready with his
broadsword, as he was with his hammer and saw. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
spirit was burning for a fight, and, joined next day by
numbers of friendly Indians and troops, under Major
Cudworth and Bradford, he pressed on to Swansea,
meeting people fleeing from their homes, wringing their
hands, and bewailing the losses of their houses and their
herds. A part of his force was sent to escort a guide
called Brown to his home at Wanamoiset, on June 23rd,
and, meeting a part of the garrison going out to bring
in corn from some deserted houses, they told the drivers
not to go on as Indians were near. "We do not fear
them," said the foragers, "for we could handle King
Philip's whole army," and thus boasting and laughing,
they proceeded onward. But scarcely had they gone
more than two miles, when loud war-cries sounded from
either side of the forests, accompanied by the sharp
crack of rifles, and, to their dismay, they found themselves
in an ambuscade. "Turn, men, back to the
town," shouted the head of the force, but, although
they quickly retreated, six of their number were shot
and fell into the roadway, where the skulking braves
soon made short work of them. In the following week
this settlement, for which they gathered provisions,
was abandoned to its fate, and the inhabitants sought
refuge in Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two hundred and fifty fighting men of
Boston had joined the intrepid Church at Swansea,
where there was skirmishing with lurking Indians in
the brush, but no battle with any great numbers of
King Philip's men. "On, on, to Mount Hope!" was
the slogan of the eager Puritans, as, with over five
hundred warriors, the angry settlers crossed over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
bridge at Swansea, and, with horsemen upon the flanks
to prevent an ambuscade, pushed on towards the home
of King Philip. They passed by groups of empty wigwams,
the smoking ruins of the homes of settlers, Bibles
torn to pieces and thrown into the roads in defiance of
their Christian teachings; while the heads of men and
women stuck on stakes bore full witness of the fury of
the savages. The rain fell in torrents as they pressed
forward to the Indian town, but, when they rushed exultantly
amid the homes of the Wampanoags, not a
savage was to be seen, and a heavy trail towards the
shore showed that all had escaped to the inland country.
Disgusted, but not disheartened, the white men camped
for the night in the drenching mist and rain, and, leaving
a force to build a fort, after a few days of fruitless search
for the savages, the soldiers retired to Swansea and
Rehoboth.</p>

<p>Philip had been too clever to be caught at his own
home, which was without strong defenses, and had
crossed the mouth of the Taunton River to the Pocasset
swampland, where he and his men had hidden themselves.
He was too wise to engage in open battle with
the English, his tactics being those of defense and quick
forage, rather than that of meeting the whites upon even
terms. Furthermore, he hoped to prolong the war until
he could get other western tribes to join with him
and thus eventually drive the English into the sea.
Should he have some great victory, he expected to gain
the assistance of the powerful Mohawks of New York
State, and with these to aid him in battle, the Colonists
would have little chance for success. So&mdash;sullenly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
craftily&mdash;he lay in the dense undergrowth, waiting for
the English to find him in his lair, while he dispatched
numerous messengers to the surrounding tribes, asking
for the aid in this desperate war.</p>

<p>And he did not have long to wait for the enemy, as
Captains Church and Fuller were soon upon his trail,
with thirty-six men who were burning for a shot at the
despoilers of their homesteads. They crossed the river
and penetrated the dense Pocasset swamp, where suddenly
a few of their number in advance ran into a
small body of the savages. These fled, without offering
to fight, and so the rest pushed forward upon the track
which the great body of Indians had left as they had
retreated into a dense pine swamp. But, suddenly,
the sharp rattle of a snake sounded from the undergrowth.
Another and still another was heard, and,
more terrified by this enemy than by the savages,
Church turned to his men to say:</p>

<p>"Back, boys! These serpents are worse than the Black
Serpents whom we search for. We must out of this and
look for the cunning varmints by a different route."</p>

<p>So they retreated from the wood, passed down the shore
towards a neck of land called Punkatee, and soon came
upon fresh Indian signs and a wigwam full of plunder.
This made them push on much faster, and suddenly they
were overjoyed to see two of the enemy in a field of
ripening peas. Church and his men immediately fell
flat upon their faces, hoping to surprise the two savages,
but the eyes of the braves were keen. They saw the
glint upon the steel breastplates of the English, and so
took to their heels. A fence lay in their path, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
they climbed it, one turned around to discharge his gun.
As he did so, a Puritan hit him with a bullet, so that he
dropped into the thicket upon the other side, with a
great yell of rage and pain. The English rushed forward,
hoping to capture him, but, like a cat with nine
lives, he wriggled away in the thick underbrush and
disappeared.</p>

<p>The Puritans pressed forward, but the sharp ping!
ping! from fifty Indian rifles spoke from the silent forest,
which warned them that they were surrounded. Blood-curdling
yells of defiance sounded in hideous unison as
they advanced, and, perceiving that they were in an
ambush, Captain Church cried out: "Retreat! Retreat
to the fence, lie down behind it, and stand off these
yelping wolves." The soldiers obeyed, and, as they
reached this friendly shelter, the hill in front of them
was fairly black with the swarming warriors of King
Philip, whose bright guns glittered in the sun. As they
spread out to surround the small band of Puritans, the
rattle of bullets in the grass warned the gallant Church
that he must retreat, or else all would be lost.</p>

<p>Giving the order to fall back to the beach, the intrepid
Captain soon had his men near the water's edge, where
they protected themselves behind fallen boulders and
stripped off their coats, so as to let their friends see them
from the opposite shore. The soldiers were so hungry
that they stopped to gather some raw peas upon the
way, being peppered by the Indian bullets as they did
so, and losing one of their number. At last they all
tumbled down behind an old hedge where Captain
Church lay, and remained quiet under a withering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
fire from the Indians, who took possession of the ruins of
an old stone house that overlooked them, and endeavored
to pick off as many as they could. A hot fight went on.
Things began to look black for the small band of Puritans,
who were now outnumbered ten to one, and whose
powder and ball began to grow very scarce.</p>

<p>In this situation, a sail boat approached from the opposite
shore, with a canoe trailing at the stern, but the
Indians kept up such a warm fusillade at her that they
made her keep some distance away. "Send your canoe
ashore," shouted the men, "and take us off, for our
ammunition is near gone and we will be overpowered."</p>

<p>But the fellows upon the boat were afraid to venture
nearer and kept a safe distance away.</p>

<p>"If you don't send your canoe ashore," roared Church,
"I will fire upon you myself. Come&mdash;paddle in so that
some of my men can get away."</p>

<p>The angry tones of the Captain apparently made the
master of the boat lose all desire to aid the band of fighters,
and away he sailed, leaving the men to shift for themselves.
The Indians, seeing the boat go away, fired
thicker and faster than ever, so that a few of the Puritans,
who were good runners, began to talk of escaping by
flight. But the courageous Captain Church exhorted
them to keep up a bold front, to save their ammunition
until they saw the head of an enemy, and to be of good
cheer, because he was certain that help would soon be at
hand. Thus he kept up the spirits of his followers
until, just at nightfall, a sloop was seen approaching.</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer came from the throats of the tired
men, as a canoe touched upon the bank, and, two at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
time, they were paddled off to the ship. Church was
the last to come off, for he had left his cutlass near an
old well in front of the Indians, and he refused to go
until he had found it. As he climbed aboard the sloop,
he took one parting shot at the savages with his last bit
of powder, which was only sufficient to send the bullet
half way to the shore. Two balls from King Philip's
men struck the canoe as he went aboard, one grazed
the hair of his head, and another partly penetrated a
stout, leather girdle right in the middle of his breast,
which was fortunately of sufficient thickness to turn
the leaden missile aside. Thus ended the first actual
skirmish of the war.</p>

<p>Philip was now safe in the swamp, so the pursuit of
his wary men was left to some Massachusetts troops who
were back from the Narragansett County, where they had
gone to secure the friendship of the Narragansett warriors.
Church's men&mdash;the soldiers from Plymouth&mdash;were
hurriedly dispatched to the town of Dartmouth, where
the savages had burned most of the houses, had stolen
cattle, sheep, and horses, and had murdered a number of
the inhabitants. Here some two hundred Wampanoags
came in and gave themselves up to the troops, upon the
strength of promises made by the Captain of the garrison
that they would receive kind treatment and would not
be harmed. But, in spite of this, the town council
voted that, inasmuch as several of these savages had
been actors in the late uprising against the whites, and,
as the rest had been compliers in the insurrection, that
they should be sold into slavery for the good of the
country. The soldiers loudly protested against this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
decision, but sold they were, and shipped to Cadiz,
Spain, under one Captain Sprague, who treated them in
a rough and brutal manner. Is it any wonder that the
rest of the Indians continued the war and refused to end
it, to give any quarter to the whites, or to sign any truce,
until their last resource had been exhausted?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Massachusetts forces had surrounded
the Pocasset cedar swamp where Philip hid with Wetamoo
(his dead brother's wife) and her men, who had
fastened bushes about themselves, so that they could
steal about undetected among the leaves and shoot
down their pursuers. Some of the Puritan troops
pushed into the undergrowth in a courageous attempt
to be the first to capture the wily chief, but they were
ambuscaded, shot at by an unseen enemy, and eight
were killed. This proved that discretion was the better
part of valor, and so the troops decided to starve out
King Philip, as the point of land on which the swamp
lay was surrounded upon all sides but one by water.
So sure, indeed, were the whites of effecting the capture
of all the Indians that a part of the troops returned to
Boston, leaving but one hundred men behind them to
finish the work and end the war with one blow. But
they little gauged the ability of King Philip as a campaigner,
for he had rather different ideas of fighting than
his opponents. Quietly getting together enough drift
wood to make a stout raft, he launched it upon the shore
(not watched by the Puritans), paddled across to the
other side of the river, and departed for the country of
the friendly Nipmucks, leaving his women and sick to
be captured by the Massachusetts troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>At daybreak, he and his men were seen by various
farmers as they passed through the open country which
lay between them and the land of the Nipmucks. At
Rehoboth, the settlers, reinforced by some fifty Mohegan
warriors, attacked him without serious loss to the
whites, although thirty of King Philip's men were soon
weltering in their own blood. The Wampanoag Chief
was fighting for his life, and he fought well, urging on
his hardy braves by word and gesture, and animating
them to deeds of daring by exposing himself freely upon
the firing line. The whites and friendly Indians were unable
to capture his devoted band and soon they were lost
in the thick forest, into the gloomy depths of which the
attackers dared not follow.</p>

<p>In a short time Philip was among the friendly Nipmucks,
uncaught, unawed by the show of English force,
and bent upon forcing the fighting to the extent of
his ability. About a fortnight before his escape from
Pocasset swamp, as the good minister in the First
Parish Church in Boston was delivering his sermon, a
courier rushed into the building, with the startling information
that the little town of Mendon had been attacked,
and that about six of the inhabitants had been
slain. The congregation left the place of worship in the
greatest alarm, for they now saw that all the Indians in
Massachusetts had risen against them, and that, if a
treaty of peace were not soon effected, a large army
would have to be sent against the savages. So a Captain
Hutchinson, escorted by a Captain Wheeler, with
twenty horsemen, was sent towards the Indian settlement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>with directions to patch up a peace. The messenger,
travelling in advance, requested the Indians to
meet the English at a certain spot, and this the Indians
agreed to do, but when Hutchinson and his men arrived
there, not a red warrior was to be seen.</p>

<p>The good Hutchinson was well known in these parts,
as he had a large farm near by, where he employed many
of the Indians in the fields, and so, hardly thinking that
they could be attacked, the men went carelessly through
the forest, whistling, laughing and singing songs of
gayety and mirth. But suddenly a shot sounded from
the gloomy depths of the wood; another and another
followed; while blood-curdling yells showed that the
Indians were near by, and had ambuscaded the unthinking
white troops. They were thrown into terrible
confusion. After a short stand they retreated as fast
as possible, taking aim at the unseen enemy from the
tree stumps and fallen timber, but, as the little band
emerged from the shadow of the trees, eight of their
number fell dead and a dozen were wounded. Wheeler
was shot clean through the body and his horse was
killed underneath him, while brave Hutchinson was so
badly injured that he died shortly afterwards. Thus,
defeated and dismayed, the troops retreated to Brookfield,
under the guidance of two friendly Praying Indians,
who knew every inch of the country, and, under their
direction, they took a bypath which led them in the
rear of a large force of redskins who had closed in on
their rear, during the skirmish in the forest, thus hoping
to annihilate them. When the disorganized band reached
the town (a settlement of twenty houses) they took
refuge in the Inn, the strongest house in the place and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
there they were immediately joined by all the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Two messengers were now dispatched on horseback to
hasten to the nearest settlements for aid, but, as they
reached the edge of the town clearing, shots rang out
from the underbrush, yells of defiance told them that the
Nipmucks were advancing, and so they returned, at
full speed, to join their friends. That evening, one of
these was peering out of a garret window, when a bullet
from the watchful enemy struck him in the forehead and
caused instant death, thus warning the defenders of the
Inn that an attempt to escape would be fruitless, and
that they must now fight to the last ditch. There were
twenty-six fighting Puritans in the fortified dwelling,
the women and children were in one room; the wounded
in another. Outside, the Indians kept up a continual
yelling and shouting as they poured volley after volley
of shot, which came against the walls like hail. They
set fire to the deserted dwellings of the town and the
crackling flames and black smoke warned the inhabitants
of Brookfield that their homes would be no longer
standing at the end of this unequal battle. The fate
that was to befall them was evident, for one rash man,
venturing out of the Inn to run to his father's house not
far away, was caught by the cruel redskins, his head was
cut off and, after kicking it about like a football, it was
placed upon a pole and set up in full view of the surrounded
Englishmen, with fierce yells and cheers of
defiance from the red demons who had killed him.</p>

<p>In the night the savages roared like so many bulls,
sang weird songs of war, and fired against the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the Inn until three o'clock in the morning, when they
attempted to set fire to the house by means of hay and
other combustibles which they brought to one corner
and touched off with a firebrand. But the brave white
men dashed out into the open under a murderous fire
from the Indians, which wounded only two, and with
great exertion put out the blaze before the Inn itself
had ignited. Meanwhile, one Ephraim Curtis, a swiftfooted
youth, crawled by the savages in the early gray
of the morning, and, eluding the vigilance of the sentinels,
made all haste for Marlborough, the nearest settlement.
His comrades grimly sat down to wait for what
Providence should bring them, determined that they
would sell their lives dear, and, if they were to die, it
would not be until after they had sent many a redskin
to the next world before them.</p>

<p>Among these Nipmucks were several renegade
Praying Indians, and, as the shot continued to pour in
upon the garrison, next morning, they collected in great
numbers near the church&mdash;only a gunshot away&mdash;and
scoffed, blasphemed and joined in a hideous attempt to
sing a mocking hymn. The garrison, with religious anger,
fired upon this ribald crew with vigor and soon saw
them retreating in confusion, carrying several dead and
wounded with them. All during the afternoon fresh
hordes of warriors came in to join the foe, while the yelling
braves redoubled their efforts to burn the Inn. Arrows,
tipped with burning rags dipped in brimstone, were
shot upon the roof, while the men within cut away the
shingles under them and put out the blaze. The yelling
braves piled hay and flax against the walls, for a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
time, which they set on fire, as they crowded around
the door in order to shoot down anyone who came
out or force an entrance should anyone open it. A ball
of fire was shot into the garret which fell in a great mass
of tow, but was fortunately extinguished immediately
by one of the soldiers, and in these fearful straits the
garrison broke down the house wall and put out the
flames from the inside.</p>

<p>"Merciful Providence, what shall we do?" shouted a
stout Puritan at this moment. "Our water has given out!"</p>

<p>"I will get more," cried one Thomas Wilson, running
into the yard, but he was shot in the upper jaw and in the
neck so painfully that he cried out in his anguish; whereupon
the Indians set up a great shout of triumph, thinking
they had killed him. Fortunately his wound was
not serious and he recovered in a short time; but he
got no water, and thus the beleagured men and women
were in desperate straits indeed. The Indians had
barricaded the end of the meetinghouse and the barn
belonging to the garrison, with boards and hay, and so,
protected from the bullets of the settlers, they fought
at close quarters and kept up an incessant fire. But,
seeing that their only hope for success was in burning
the house, they now brought up a cart which was made
from a barrel and piled with hemp, flax, hay and other
inflammable materials, and set it on fire, as they rolled
it towards the mansion. Nothing, it seemed, could now
save the Colonists, for the poles on the cart were of such
a length that the whites could not hit the Indians who
pushed it. At this awful moment, Heaven came to
the aid of the courageous English. A heavy thunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
shower suddenly fell, and, as the burning cart was
extinguished by the raindrops, the Indians set up a wail
of disappointment, as they heard the cheers from the
interior of the Inn.</p>

<p>Two days and a night had now elapsed since the
messenger to the settlements had passed through the
lines of hostile Indians, and, whether he had reached the
friends of the settlers or not, was unknown to the now
worn-out defenders of the last house in Brookfield. They
gloomily fired at the savages as they cautiously showed
themselves, and, as the darkness of another night began
to fall, you can well imagine their feelings of excitement,
when, above the howlings of the Nipmucks, was heard
the tramp of a column of horse. The Indians began to
withdraw&mdash;they suddenly disappeared altogether&mdash;and,
to the joy of all, a gray-haired Puritan at the head of
some forty-six stout Massachusetts yeomen rode into
the streets of the town and rescued the half-starved
garrison. Cheer after cheer rent the air, as the danger
was known to be past. By the lurid light of some
burning barns, the Nipmucks retreated into the blackness,
firing desultory and random shots at the reinforcements
as they did so. The garrison was saved. Women
sobbed aloud; strong men wept like babies; and tears
of cheerfulness were intermingled with those of sorrow for
the brave fellows who had fallen in the fray. Brookfield
was soon abandoned by all, and the cattle of the once
prosperous settlers grazed among the ruined walls and
charred timbers of the homes of their masters. King
Philip's men had well begun their awful work upon the
people of New England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>And this dread destruction continued, for the settlers
were few, their homes were without stockades, and they
were thoroughly unprepared for making a decent resistance
against the overwhelming numbers of the
Indians. The Nipmucks, with King Philip as director
of affairs, had moved westward towards the town
of Hadley, where was a large Indian encampment of
supposedly friendly red men. "We will go out and
fight Philip," they told the English. "We are your
friends, not his." But the friendly Mohegan warriors
gathered about the Puritan leaders. "Do not believe
them," said they, "for they will give the enemy warning,
when on the warpath, by shouting. Do not believe
them." So, it was ordered that these warriors should
come to the English troops and give up their arms, in
token of their friendship. But the Indians left their
village in a body (it was a group of wigwams with a
stockade about it) and fled. The English pursued, next
day, and overtook them in a swamp ten miles distant,
where they attacked with vigor, firing from behind trees
and boulders in true frontier fashion. The fight was
sharp and bloody. It lasted for three hours, and in the
end, the savages made good their retreat, leaving twenty-six
warriors upon the field, while nine of the Englishmen
died in the arms of their comrades, who were unable
to capture a single red man.</p>

<p>Not far off was the little settlement of Deerfield, with
about one hundred and twenty-six sturdy settlers living
there. Three of the houses had palisades about them,
but the rest were thoroughly unprotected. Philip's
emissary had stirred up all the Indians hereabouts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
men went to meeting with their arms over their shoulders;
ammunition was stored in the meetinghouse and
each man furnished himself with at least five charges of
powder and shot. In spite of this, the Indians found
them thoroughly unprepared, when, a week later, they
fell upon the little settlement, and, although the settlers
rallied together in the centre of the village, the redskins
soon set fire to all the houses and barns beyond range
of the white men's trusty flintlocks. Not daring to
leave the protection of their palisades, they saw the
labor of long years of patient toil go up in smoke, while
their sheep, oxen, and cows were driven off by their
enemies. A few days later, Squakeog, a town fifteen
miles distant, met the same fate, while some nine or ten
settlers, who did not reach the garrison house soon
enough, were easily slain by the crafty Indian braves.
The red hand of war lay heavy upon the Massachusetts
frontier.</p>

<p>It was now September, and the soft haze of Indian
summer drowsily hung over the once peaceful hills and
valleys of Massachusetts, making it so strange to believe
in war, that even the followers of King Philip found it
impossible to fight. But the stern commands of the
last of the Wampanoags was for more slaughter, and, a
month after the burning of Brookfield&mdash;when most of
the garrison was absent from Hadley&mdash;the savages fell
upon it with sudden and unexpected fury. It was fast-day,
and the people were in the meetinghouse, when
a wild warwhoop sounded from the forest, the loud
report of a musket followed, and, as the startled congregation
rushed into the street, a band of howling red men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
poured into the village with yells of savage hatred and
defiance. Seizing their ever-present flintlocks, the
men of Hadley backed away to the garrison house,
forming a screen for the women and children behind
them, but it was impossible to reach it, as they were
cut off by the swarms of Indians. They retreated to
another building (incapable of being defended from the
inside) and here held off the exultant braves. It was a
desperate situation, for should they go down before the
onslaught, no quarter would be given to their loved
ones and the Puritans knew that they must win in order
to keep all that was dearest to them in life. Their
hands trembled as they fired at the whooping warriors,
now crouching behind fence posts and buildings, and
pouring a steady fire into the brave defenders of Hadley,
who, unnerved by the sight of their helpless families,
fought grimly and desperately as the savages pressed
ever nearer in front. The Puritans wavered; their line
fell back and the fate of Hadley hung upon the trembling
balance of a moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a loud cry sounded from the interior of the
house, and an aged man of soldierly bearing and commanding
presence, rushed into the open with sword
in hand. "On, Englishmen, on!" he shouted, "back
with this yelling vermin! Back! Drive them into the
forest!"</p>

<p>There was a quick response from the stout Puritans,
who were not lacking in courage, but who needed leadership.
They rose to their feet. They rushed forward
upon the yelling foe. In the place of despair, now
energy and hope stirred their hearts, and as the calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
old man walked among them with words of cheer, they
pressed upon the attackers with a new vigor. The
Indians fell back with dismay, and, as numbers of their
foremost scouts were knocked to the ground&mdash;pierced
by the well-directed shots of the English&mdash;suddenly they
fled into the woods, pursued by the impetuous defenders
of Hadley on the dead run. When the sound of the retreat
had died away, the men gathered together in the
village to thank their aged leader. He was not there.
From whence he had come, no one knew, and none had
seen him disappear. The man was a mystery.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the fierce fighting at Hadley and
of the strange appearance of the ancient knight, whose
presence turned the tide of conflict at a time when
victory was most needed. It would be pleasant to believe
that this were some friendly spirit come to aid the
Puritans&mdash;some ghostly retainer from the dim ages of
the past&mdash;but such cannot be the case. Eventually, it
was known that one Colonel Goffe&mdash;a fugitive from
England&mdash;was concealed in the house of a Mr. Russell at
Hadley, and, as he was an old soldier and a veteran of
the war in England, it was impossible for him to remain
quiet when he saw the doughty villagers getting the
worst of the battle with the Indians. It was unknown
to the people that he was among them, for he was a
regicide (or assassin of the King of England) and had
he been discovered, it would have been necessary for
some citizen or some magistrate to have returned him
to the mother country. Fortunate, indeed, had it been
for the people of Hadley that a fugitive from justice had
been among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>September was a fatal month for the English. On
the same day that Hadley was attacked, a large force of
King Philip's men visited Deerfield, where they burned
several houses and barns, and killed two men. At
Northfield, the blockhouse was besieged, all the dwelling
houses were burned, and a dozen settlers were slaughtered
by the savages, while a Captain Beers, who went to the
relief of the town with thirty soldiers, was ambuscaded
by the Indians and killed. Only ten of his followers
escaped. Deerfield was again attacked, and more
houses were burned, while the surrounding country was
swept bare of all settlers, farm utensils, and cattle belonging
to the whites. The frontiersmen clustered together
at Deerfield and Hadley, determined to sell their
lives dear, if the worst came to the worst, and eagerly
awaited an opportunity to avenge themselves upon their
cruel foe.</p>

<p>When the farmers fled from the vicinity of Deerfield,
they left a quantity of unthreshed grain, and so a company
of eighty picked men&mdash;the flower of Essex County&mdash;under
the command of Captain Lathrop of Ipswich,
was sent from Hadley to complete the threshing and load
the grain on wagons. This they did, and as they were
returning through the forest, the soldiers halted in a
grove of trees near a brook, where the men broke ranks
and loitered to and fro in the shade, off their guard, and
with their muskets and armor upon the ground. But
alas! the crafty Indians had been all night upon their
trail, waiting for just such an opportunity, and suddenly
seven hundred painted braves, sheltered by the
trees, poured a withering fire of balls and arrows into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
unsuspecting followers of Lathrop. All but seven of
the whites were killed, the rest escaped through the
dense forest to bear the sad tidings to their friends,
while the Indians held a riotous scalp dance over the
remains of their victims. Because of this massacre,
the brook, to this day, is called Bloody Brook.</p>

<p>As the savages sang and danced hilariously, a Captain
Mosely, who had heard the firing and had seen the
fugitives, hurried to the spot with several followers.
From eleven o'clock in the morning, until dusk, he held
his own against the redskins, when one hundred whites
and sixty friendly Mohegan Indians arrived to assist
him. The victorious savages were driven off with great
loss and were pursued for some distance, while only one
white man was killed and eleven were wounded. When
Captain Mosely came up as the followers of King Philip
were collecting spoils and scalps, he took off his wig and
stuffed it into his breeches pocket so that he could be
in good fighting trim, and thus use his rifle with ease.
This act was seen by the Indians, and one cried out:</p>

<p>"Englishman got two heads! Me cut off one, he got
another and put it on! Ugh! Ugh! I no like to fight
man with two heads." And in consequence of this,
several of the braves made off into the gloom of the
forest, believing that they were leagued against Old
Nick.</p>

<p>Philip, himself, was not active in these skirmishes
and seems to have directed the plan of operations from
his own wigwam and not to have taken a very prominent
part in the fighting. Although numerous captives were
brought to him, there is not an instance of his having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
maltreated a single white person, even while the hard-fisted
Puritans were selling his own people into European
slavery, or torturing and hanging them. A Mrs. Rowlandson
was captured and brought to his camp where
he not only invited her to call at his lodge, but, when
she did so, bade her sit down and smoke a peace pipe.
When next he met her, he requested her to make a
garment for his child, and gave her a shilling for it. He
afterwards took the trouble to visit her in order to tell
her that "in a fortnight she should be her own mistress."
What is still more to his credit, we read that when a
certain James Brown of Swanzey came to his camp with
a letter just before the commencement of hostilities, and
the young warriors were about to kill him, Philip interfered
and stopped these wild braves, saying that his
father had told him to show kindness to Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>On the breaking of the war the King of the Wampanoags
gave strict orders that no one should injure any of
the members of the Leonard family, for these people had
been very kind to him and had often repaired his guns
when out of order. Thus the settlement of Taunton&mdash;where
the Leonards resided&mdash;was almost entirely unmolested
during the war, although in the very path of
the struggling armies. Instances such as this show King
Philip to have been a man of warm impulses, generosity,
kindness, and forbearance&mdash;characteristics which
some of the Puritan leaders, themselves, were lacking in.</p>

<p>The war had been disastrous for the English, and,
stung with the bitterness of defeat, those in power determined
to now use every effort to cripple the allied
tribes under the leadership of Philip. The Narragansetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
were secret allies of the Wampanoag Chief, and, as they
had a large fort in South Kingston, R. I., built upon
five or six acres of dry ground and encircled by a swamp,
it was determined to attack and burn the stronghold.
Palisades and a circle of felled trees surrounded the
citadel, and it was defended by numerous warriors
armed with flintlock muskets, which they had either
stolen, or bartered, from the English. Massachusetts
furnished five hundred and twenty soldiers for the army
of conquest, Plymouth one hundred and fifty-nine, and
Connecticut three hundred, while one hundred and fifty
friendly Mohegan Indians went along as guides and
scouts. This army of over a thousand men moved
against the Narragansetts&mdash;under the leadership of
stout Governor Winslow of Plymouth&mdash;confident of
success, and singing hymns of victory. It was in December&mdash;the
snow lay deep upon the ground&mdash;but it did
not chill the ardent spirits of the Puritan troops.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon the soldiers were in
the vicinity of the fort and ready for the assault. They
lined up in preparation for a rush upon the entrance,
which was protected by a high blockhouse and had, in
front of it, a log breastwork about five feet high, but,
as luck would have it, a long log of considerable thickness
jutted out through the palisade, and, with a rush, the
Massachusetts men ran over the frozen swamp, leaped
upon the fallen tree trunk and pushed towards the
entrance. A withering fire from the Narragansetts threw
them into confusion, and, in order to save themselves
from slaughter, the brave soldiers cast themselves upon
their faces. Many were killed and lay about in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
snow, but, not daunted for an instant by this savage
fire, the white soldiers again leaped to their feet, and,
cheered by the cry, "They run," "They run," stormed
over the tree, penetrated the stockade, and drove the
Indians out of their position in the blockhouse.</p>

<p>Many continued to fall, while the Narragansetts,
rallying again, began to press forward. But, at this
juncture, the Connecticut troops made their way into
the stockade through a breach in the palisade and took
the warriors in the flank. All the Puritan leaders of
this division fell dead, but the soldiers struggled like
demons, and, as the men of Plymouth scrambled into
the opening made by their entrance, the Narragansetts
fell back, foot by foot, while the warriors fought desperately
from the shelter of the bags and baskets of grain
in the wigwams. At this moment fire burst from the
tepees and the wind swept a mighty wave of flame
through the fort, while the crackling of the burning
wood and skins was mingled with the shrieks of the
women and children, the yelling of the warriors, and the
harsh yells of the sturdy Puritans.</p>

<p>The Indians were driven from the stockade into the
swamp, where from the shelter of the thick wood, they
still kept up a vigorous fire on the white troops, but, as
the gloom of a wild winter's night settled upon the scene
of battle, those Puritan leaders who had survived the
carnage gathered around Captain Winslow in the glare
of the blazing wigwams, while the driving snow turned
their figures white against the flaming background.
Their ammunition was nearly exhausted, and, as they
knew that the Narragansetts&mdash;after rallying in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
morning&mdash;might be upon them, a retreat was decided
upon. So the tired and weary troops, leaving twenty
of the dead in the fort to deceive the Indians, and carrying
the wounded upon litters made of muskets and
saplings, began a long and dreary march to the settlements.
Many lost their way and wandered all night
amid the storm, while seven of the Captains and about
seventy-five of the soldiers died as a result of this exposure
during the next few days. It had been a bitter
contest, and the blow had not been a decisive one, as
Philip&mdash;the wary and indefatigable Indian leader&mdash;was
still alive.</p>

<p>The little town of Lancaster is in the far interior of
Massachusetts, and this was attacked, next year, in
February, by the Wachusett Indians. One of the
Sachems of this tribe had married a sister of Philip's
wife and thus there was a close bond of sympathy between
these warlike people and the followers of the
King of the Wampanoags. There were several garrison
houses in the village, and in one&mdash;the Rowlandson
house&mdash;were gathered about fifty men and women,
who, awakened one cold and cheerless morning by the
wild Indian war cry, rushed to the windows and looked
out. The sight which met their eyes was terrifying,
for several houses were in flames, and the Indians, whose
dim forms were almost indistinct in the morning haze,
were massacring the inmates with knives, muskets
and tomahawks.</p>

<p>Soon the Rowlandson house itself was attacked, and,
as it lay on the summit of a hill, the Indians crouched
along the crest and poured a continuous fire upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
For two hours the defenders held their own, until a cart
filled with flax, hemp and hay&mdash;seized from the barn&mdash;was
wheeled to the side and set on fire. The roof and
sides of the garrison house were soon alight, and men,
women and children rushed out in the vain hope of
reaching the next house. It was in vain. They were
all either killed or captured. The Indians carried off
the cattle and survivors of the attack, while, a few days
later, the town was abandoned to its fate.</p>

<p>Deerfield had also been deserted, and the Indians had
taken possession of the untilled cornfields and had
planted them afresh; while some miles beyond, at the
falls on the Connecticut River, a large body of them
was camped, in order to catch a supply of fish for King
Philip's armies. A stout Captain Turner was at Hatfield
when news was brought that the savages were near
by in force, so, gathering one hundred mounted men, he
made a night ride of twenty miles, and, as the sound of
the approach was deadened by the rapids in the river,
the English found the Indians fast asleep. At daybreak,
on May 10th, the troops left their horses in a
ravine and marched a mile or two to the rear of the
savages, who had been so certain of their seclusion that
they had not even posted a guard. Spreading out in a
circle, the Puritans suddenly made a rush into the camp.
The surprise was complete, and although many of the
savages took to their canoes, they were washed over
the falls and drowned in the frothing, eddying water.
Many hid among the rocks, but they were seized and put
to death by the sword; while scores were shot as they
attempted to cross the river. Over three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
warriors were thus destroyed, while the gallant Turner
did not lose a single soldier, and, from this success, had
the honor of having the falls named after him.</p>

<p>Not far off was another party of Indians, and, when
they heard the noise of the fight, they came to the aid
of their own blood, and were soon on Turner's tracks.
Sad to relate, a panic seized the white troops&mdash;for a
rumor was spread about that King Philip was at hand
with a thousand warriors. A large number of the whites
were cut off; Turner himself was killed; but the main
body, with their tongues fairly hanging from their
mouths&mdash;like the British troops in the retreat from
Lexington&mdash;reached the settlement at Hatfield. The
disaster had been a severe blow to Philip, for it broke up
his fishery and many of his best sachems had been
slain. In reprisal, he made an attack upon Hatfield,
but the Indian warriors were so badly whipped that they
retreated into the wilderness to mourn their losses and
prepare for the last desperate stand of the war.</p>

<p>It was now spring of the year 1676, and, realizing
that they must use every effort to put an end to hostilities,
the Colonies called into active service every
able-bodied man or boy who could shoulder a musket.
All who could be spared from work upon the farms were
sent out upon expeditions against the various bands of
warring savages. Nor were the whites always successful,
for many disasters came to the different bands of
fighting men, as they marched and countermarched
through the dense woodland of the interior of Massachusetts,
where the moose still had its habitation, and
the beaver, lynx, and bear were often to be met with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Thus one Captain Wadsworth was surprised as he went
to the relief of Sudbury, Massachusetts, was entrapped
in an ambush, and was killed, with sixty of his men.
Shortly afterwards, a Captain Pierce with fifty Englishmen
and twenty friendly Indians, when but eight
miles from Providence, was surrounded, and, although
his men formed in a circle, back to back, they were
practically all killed or captured.</p>

<p>A messenger from the Captain was waiting at the
church door, to inform a Captain Edwards that Pierce
needed assistance, as the fierce fight was going on in the
woods, and, had he not delayed in giving his message,
because it was Sunday, and he did not want to disturb
the meeting, there is no doubt that this fight would
have had a different termination. Not long afterwards,
things were reversed, and three hundred mounted men&mdash;English
and Praying Indians&mdash;overtook a body of nearly
the same number of Narragansetts in a swamp in their
own country and completely annihilated them. Their
chief was asked if he had anything to say before they
executed him. "Yes," said he, "I shall die before my
heart is soft, or I have said anything unworthy of
myself. It is well. Ugh! Ugh!"</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end. The tide of success
for King Philip began to ebb, and, under the leadership
of that hard, fighting man, Captain Church (who
was more than a match for the Indians in cunning,
as well as courage), those warriors who were still in the
field against the whites were soon driven to the last
ditch. Day and night Church followed the savages into
the swamps and forests, so that they were reduced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
live&mdash;if they did not actually starve or freeze&mdash;upon
dead horses, clams and roots. The loss of chiefs and
warriors disheartened the Indians, and their large
expeditions were abandoned; while to distract pursuit,
they split into small parties and fled into the solitude
of the forest. Philip himself retreated to the neighborhood
of his former settlement at Mount Hope, like
a fox, who, when the hounds are hot upon his trail,
seeks his burrow. He was set upon on all sides, and only
escaped capture by many a hairbreadth.</p>

<p>The red warrior was now a desolate and desperate
man, the last Sachem of an ancient race, without subjects,
without territory, hunted like a deer, in daily fear
of capture, in danger of starving and with no shelter at
night for his head. All of his chief counsellors and best
friends had been killed; his uncle was shot down at his
side; his wife and child (an only son) were captured.
Alone, friendless, and deserted, he hid in the dense
forest, awaiting the doom which surely and relentlessly
awaited him. "You have made Philip ready to die;
you have made him as poor and miserable as he used
to make the English, for you have now killed and taken
all his relatives," said some Indian prisoners whom
Church captured, as he looked for the Wampanoag
Chief in the swamp.</p>

<p>Philip was hiding near Assowomset Pond, while
numerous bodies of mounted troops and friendly Indians
guarded the trails which led to it and scoured the
country in all directions. So hunted and afraid was he
that he fled southward in the hope of reaching the
country of the Narragansetts. Hot in pursuit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
fleeing Sachem, Captain Church left Plymouth in search
of the quarry, beat the woods about Pocasset, and
finally ferried his men across the arm of Narragansett
Bay&mdash;which here juts into the land&mdash;and camped with
them in Rhode Island. The Captain paid a visit to a
friend's house, some eight miles away, when two horsemen
rode up, who called out:</p>

<p>"What will you give for some news of Philip, Captain?"</p>

<p>"I will give a good deal," replied the rough soldier.</p>

<p>"Then we can tell you where he is," said one&mdash;a
Major Sanford&mdash;"for a Wampanoag has just come to
our camp and told us that, as Philip had killed his brother
for giving him advice that displeased him, he had fled
from him, fearing the same fate, and, in revenge, will
tell us where to find him."</p>

<p>"Let me see him at once," cried Church. "We will
immediately be upon King Philip's trail."</p>

<p>So, riding immediately into the camp where the
Wampanoag had been taken, they found him willing
to guide them to Philip's hiding place. The whole
English force, marching with great speed, crossed the
water at Bristol Ferry, and soon arrived shortly after
midnight at the north end of a miry swamp near Mount
Hope. A small force was sent into the underbrush at
daybreak to beat up Philip's hiding place and drive
him into flight, while soldiers and Indians were placed
behind trees, all around the swamp, so as to stop him if
he attempted to get out.</p>

<p>"I have placed my men so that it is scarce possible
for Philip to escape," said Captain Church to a companion,
when suddenly a shot whistled over their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and the noise of a gun in the direction of Philip's camp
was immediately followed by the sound of a volley.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers had crept upon their stomachs
close to the sleeping camp, when the Captain in charge
saw an Indian looking at him from behind a stump. He
consequently fired at him immediately, and thus the
Indian camp was, in a second, thrown into confusion.
The Indian who had been shot at had been missed. It
was Philip, who, seizing his pouch, gun, and powder
horn, plunged immediately into the swamp, clad only
in his trousers and moccasins.</p>

<p>As the King of the Wampanoags dashed down one of
the many trails leading into the undergrowth, he was
seen by a soldier and a friendly Indian from their hiding
place behind a tree. The soldier raised his gun to fire,
but the morning mist had dampened his powder and his
musket would not go off. But the Indian fired immediately,
sending one bullet through the heart of King
Philip, and another, two inches above it. The great
chief fell upon his face in the mud, while the savage who
had laid him low rushed to Church with the news, and,
when the whole force was assembled and had been informed
of Philip's fate, they greeted the information
with loud cheers. The friendly Indians, seizing the body
by the leggins, drew it out of the mud to the highland,
where it was immediately cut up. The head was severed
from the body, carried to Plymouth, set upon a pole and
paraded through the streets. It was then placed in a
conspicuous spot, where it remained for nearly twenty-five
years.</p>

<p>The death of the mighty Sachem of the Wampanoags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
practically ended the war, although some Indians, in
small parties, held out a bit longer throughout all of
New England. Hostilities had lasted for more than a
year, and had been disastrous to the settlers; for thirteen
towns had been destroyed, six hundred buildings
had been burned, six hundred men had been either
killed or tomahawked; numberless cows, sheep and
horses had been stolen, and great numbers of the men
of New England had been disabled by wounds. There
was hardly a family throughout Massachusetts and
Rhode Island that did not mourn its dead. The power
of the Indians had been forever destroyed, for not only
had many families been entirely obliterated, but hundreds
had been driven to the far West, or had been captured,
sent to the West Indies, and sold as slaves.</p>

<p>Philip had fought his fight, and had fallen, as a guardian
of his own honor, a martyr to the soil of his fathers,
and of the proud liberty which was his birthright.
Never again was the Indian to possess the soil of New
England and hunt in freedom and ease through its forests,
as of yore. The Anglo-Saxon had conquered, and to
the white man and his civilization the land was to forever
belong. Thus the first great war between the different
races ended just as all subsequent conflicts between
the red men and the white were to terminate. The
white man was to be found invincible.</p>

<h2>PONTIAC: THE RED NAPOLEON</h2>


<p>The war waged by King Philip had put an end to
all further hindrance to the settlement of New
England by the whites, and the hostile Indians
had been wellnigh exterminated. But, as the restless
settlers pressed westward, ever westward, to populate
the untouched wilderness and to build hamlets and cultivate
farms, it was only natural that the western
Indians would view their advance with the same anger
that had smouldered in the bosom of the chief Sachem
of the Wampanoags. The French, in Canada, were
more peaceably disposed towards the savages than were
the English; they treated them with some consideration
and kindness; sent their Jesuit Missionaries among them;
and endeavored to teach them the ways of civilization.
As the English pressed onward they were continually in
altercations with the various tribes which lay in the
path of their steady emigration, and they showed them
little consideration, kindness, or toleration.</p>

<p>In 1755 war broke out between the French and
English for the possession of America. Both were rival
claimants for the soil of the New World, and the people
of the northern English colonies had learned to regard
their Canadian neighbors&mdash;the French&mdash;with the bitterest
enmity. They hated them because they were
of a different religious faith than their own, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
hated them because they were friends of the very
Indians who made depredations upon their frontier
settlements and slaughtered the peace-loving white
settlers. The Indians were plyed with gifts and flattered
by the French, so that, in the fierce struggle for the
possession of America, the red warriors sided, for the
most part, with those who held dominion over Canada
and the Great Lakes. The English won the war, and
thus the wilderness beyond the Allegheny mountains,
over which France had claimed sovereignty, passed into
the hands of her rival, who, with a force of but five or
six hundred men, expected to keep it secure. Little
apprehension was felt of an attack from the red inhabitants
of the woods, and, as the French had signed a
capitulation, the English considered themselves safe in
the possession of this new-won territory. But they
were far from being safe, and much fighting was still
to be done before peace and tranquility were to come
to the frontier.</p>

<p>The furthermost settlement of the English was at
Detroit, between Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair, and
upon the river of the same name. There were about
twenty-five hundred inhabitants in this little community.
Straggling huts were along the river banks,
and in the centre was a fortified town, called the Fort,
consisting of about a hundred houses surrounded by
a palisade. A British garrison, consisting partly of
regulars and partly of provincial rangers, was quartered
in well-built barracks inside the town, or Fort. There
were about one hundred and twenty soldiers, forty fur-traders,
and a few half-breed scouts who could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
relied upon in case of a war with the redskins. Several
light pieces of artillery were mounted upon the
bastions, while two small armed schooners&mdash;the Beaver
and the Gladwyn&mdash;lay anchored in the stream. The garrison
was commanded by a splendid English officer,
named Gladwyn, whose courage was that of a lion,
and whose fighting qualities were far superior to most
of the British officers who were engaged in the struggles
upon the frontier. A large Indian village of the Pottawattamies
was on the western shore of the river, a little
below the fort; while, nearly opposite, on the eastern
side, was a village of the Wyandots; and on the same
side, five miles away, the Ottawas, under Chief Pontiac,
had fixed their abode.</p>

<p>Although the Indians appeared to be on friendly terms
with those in the town, the country had scarcely been
transferred to the English&mdash;at the conclusion of the
French and Indian war&mdash;when smothered murmurs of
discontent began to be heard among all the Indian
tribes of the interior. From the headwaters of the
Potomac River to Lake Superior, and along the winding
courses of the Mississippi, a deep-seated hatred of the
English increased with great rapidity. When the French
had held possession of Detroit and the forts upon the
frontier, they had supplied the surrounding Indians
with guns, ammunition and clothing, but the English
would give them nothing. The French had been kind
to the savages when they visited their forts, but the
English received them with cold looks and harsh words,
when, as was their custom, they would lounge about the
fort and lazily stretch themselves out in the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the walls. This was galling to their proud and haughty
spirits. Then, too, the best lands of the red men were
being invaded by white settlers and all remonstrances
had been useless. The Delawares and Shawanoes, in
particular, were highly exasperated at this, and their
feelings were shared by all the surrounding tribes, in
whose breasts slumbered a terrible hatred and distrust
of the oncoming English, who had been their enemies in
the late war and towards whom the Indians had the
rancorous enmity that an Indian always feels against
those to whom he has been opposed in battle.</p>

<p>Pontiac was principal chief of the Ottawas and head
of a loose confederacy of the Ottawas, Ojibwas, and
Pottawattamies. He was about fifty years of age: tall,
sinewy, strong. Over those around him his authority
was almost despotic, while his name was known and
respected among all the savages who resided in the country,
stretching from the Ohio River to the lowest waters
of the Mississippi. He possessed great energy, craftiness,
and oratorical prowess, while his courage in war
was far-famed. It is said that he commanded the
Ottawas in the defeat of General Braddock at Fort Du-Quesne&mdash;during
the French and Indian war&mdash;and it
is certain that he was treated with much honor by the
French officers, for one of them had presented him with
the regimentals of a soldier of that country, which he
is only known to have worn upon one occasion. Not
long before the beginning of the French and Indian war,
he had saved the French garrison at Detroit from an
attack from some discontented tribes of the North, who
had marched to destroy it. For this he had been made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>much of by the French officers. "He puts on an air of
majesty and princely grandeur," said Major Rogers,
(one of his opponents), "and is greatly honored and
revered by his subjects."</p>

</div>


<p>Pontiac saw that the Indian race was now confronted
with a grave crisis, for, when Canada had become an
English province, the tribes had sunk from their former
position of importance. Up to this time, France and
England&mdash;the two rival European nations&mdash;had kept
each other in check upon the American continent and
the Indians had been flattered by each, for their services
were needed by both. Now the English had gained undisputed
control of America, and the Indians, being no
longer important as allies, were treated as animals of a
lower order of intellect who could be trampled upon with
impunity. Thus the mind of the wily Ottawa Chief
conceived the idea of driving the English into the sea,
of once more restoring the French to power, in the West,
and thus to again place the Indians in their former position
of influence. The French Canadians continually
told him falsehoods, assuring him that the war had not
been lost by the French, that the armies of King Louis
were now on their way to recover Canada, and that the
French and their red allies could soon drive the hated
English away from their beloved country. Stirred by
these lies, and urged on by revenge, ambition, and
patriotism, Pontiac decided upon war.</p>

<p>The various Indian tribes which lived along the
Mississippi; in the country of the Ohio River and its
many tributaries; and along the cold waters of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Ottawa to the north, were visited in 1762 by ambassadors
from Pontiac. They carried with them a tomahawk
stained red and a war-belt of wampum, and, as
they went from camp to camp, they would fling down
the tomahawk on the ground, hold the war-belt above
their heads, and deliver a long speech, urging the warriors
to join in the extermination of the English. Everywhere
this appeal was heard with nods and gesticulations
of approval, and all of the Algonquin nation&mdash;including
the Wyandots, the Senecas, and several tribes of the
lower Mississippi&mdash;pledged themselves to aid in this
important movement. Of the powerful Iroquois nation
of New York State only the Senecas would join, but the
force against the whites was so overwhelming that it
seemed hardly possible that the few scattered English
garrisons could escape a terrible slaughter. Yet, confident
in that supreme race confidence which has made the
English the most all-powerful nation since the Roman
legions held dominion over the greater part of Europe,
the white garrisons of the wilderness kept their posts in
fancied peace and seclusion.</p>

<p>The dreary winter drew to a close, and the Indians hid
their intentions beneath calm and serious countenances.
They still lounged about the forts, begged for tobacco,
gunpowder, and whiskey, and gave no sign of intended
wrong or violence. Yet they were busy sawing the
muzzles of their guns in half so that they could conceal
them underneath their blankets, were gathering a
large supply of powder and ammunition from the
French traders, and were holding war-dances in their
far-distant habitation. Now and again intimations
of their danger reached the garrisons and startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
them from their fancied security. An English trader
came into Detroit one day, and reported that he had
heard a half-breed scoundrel boast that before next
summer he would have English scalp-locks as a fringe
to his hunting-shirt. The commander of the garrison
laughed at the tale. Later on&mdash;in March 1763&mdash;the
British commander Holmes, at Fort Miami, on the
Maumee River (about one hundred and ninety miles
southwest from Detroit) was told of Pontiac's conspiracy
by a friendly Indian. "The warriors of the
neighboring village," said he, "have received a war-belt
and bloodstained hatchet, with a message urging
them to destroy you and your soldiers. If you do not
kill them first, they will do so." Holmes believed the
tale, called the warriors together, and told them of his
suspicions. The savages acted as many of them have
done under similar circumstances&mdash;confessed that they
had meditated an attack upon the garrison, said that a
neighboring tribe had told them they must do it, under
pain of death, and professed eternal love and good
will towards the English. This allayed the suspicions
of the commander of Fort Maumee, but he reported his
discovery to Major Gladwyn, at Detroit, who, seeing
the peaceful condition of the Indians in the three villages
near his own fort, expressed the opinion that there
was apparently some trouble among the Indians, but that
it would soon blow over. He little suspected that
Pontiac&mdash;the arch-conspirator&mdash;was in a village but a
short distance away, and that his heart was burning
with revenge and hate against him and his small garrison.
He little believed that, as the savages came in from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
their winter hunting grounds, on the approach of spring,
and did not come into the fort, as usual, they were fast
making preparations for an assault upon him. In a
few weeks he was to learn more of the Indians' character
than he had ever suspected.</p>

<p>Pontiac had a small cabin of bark and rushes upon
an island in Lake St. Clair, and here, with his squaws
and children, he waited for the time to arrive when his
braves would be ready to strike. His plan of operations
was to make a sudden and simultaneous attack upon all
the British forts on the Great Lakes and rivers of the
Middle West&mdash;at St. Joseph, Ouiantinon, Green Bay,
Michillimackinac, Detroit, the Maumee, and the Sandusky&mdash;and
also upon the forts at Niagara, Presqu'-Isle,
Le Boeuf, Venango, and Pittsburg. Most of these
strongholds were badly protected; they were mere
trading places, yet to the Indians they seemed to be
great obstacles. It was evident to the mighty war
Chief that the destruction of these posts and their
garrisons would be a blow from which the hated English
could never recover. And, as he lay upon his skins,
looking out across the hazy waters of the Lake, his heart
beat with the fierceness of his passions, and the hot
blood surged tumultuously through his veins. All was
going well with his plans; on all sides his allies were
preparing for the great blow, and, viewing once more
the supremacy of the French and of his own people, the
fierce light of ambition glittered in the eye of Pontiac,
the red Napoleon. Thus, as spring came to the wilderness,
and the leafy forests were resounding with the
chant of bright-colored birds, the wild death songs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the Indians sounded harshly discordant from the
depths of the green wood.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fifth of May, a Canadian
woman, called St. Aubin, who was the wife of one of the
principal settlers, crossed over the Detroit River to obtain
some maple sugar and venison from the Ottawa
Indians. When she entered the village, she was surprised
to find several of the warriors filing off the muzzles
of their guns, so as to reduce them to the length of
about a yard, and upon her return home she mentioned
this to several of her neighbors. The blacksmith of
the village remarked that many of the Indians had been
to his shop within the past month, and had attempted
to borrow files and saws for purposes which they could
not tell him of. These revelations excited the suspicions
of the older Canadians who had lived long among the
Indians, so, going to the Fort, one of them&mdash;as spokesman&mdash;told
Major Gladwyn to be upon his guard, for the
Indians meditated treachery. The courteous commandant
treated this advice with scorn, and scoffed at the
news of an outbreak.</p>

<p>But, in a day or two, news came to him which changed
his ideas very materially. In the Pottawattamie
village was an Ojibwa girl, called Catherine, who was
much attached to this gallant Major in charge of the
British troops. On the day following the first announcement
of trouble, she came to Gladwyn's quarters, bringing
with her a pair of elkskin moccasins which he had
requested her to make, and, showed by her downcast
face and sad look that she had something unusual on
her mind. Her demeanor was so peculiar that Gladwyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
called her to him and requested that she tell him what
weighed upon her spirits. "Promise me that you will
not betray me," said the Indian girl, "and I will reveal
my secret."</p>

<p>"I promise," answered the intrepid soldier.</p>

<p>"Then I will speak," continued the Ojibwa maiden.
"Tomorrow Pontiac will come to the fort with sixty of
his chiefs. Each will be armed with a gun cut short off
and hidden beneath his blanket. Pontiac will demand
a council, and, after he has delivered his speech, he will
offer you a peace-belt of wampum, holding it in a reversed
position. This will be the signal for an attack.
The chiefs will spring up and fire upon the officers, and
the Indians in the street will fall upon the garrison.
Every Englishman will be killed, but not the scalp of a
single Frenchman will be touched."</p>

<p>The English Major was now thoroughly aroused to his
peril. He called together his officers and told them
what he had heard. Immediately, every preparation
was made to meet the expected attack, half the garrison
was ordered under arms, and all the officers made ready
to spend the night upon the ramparts, for, as the Indians
nearly numbered from six hundred to two thousand,
the commandant feared that they might learn that their
plan had been discovered and would storm the fort before
morning. The sentries were doubled, and, again
and again, during the night, Gladwyn mounted the ramparts
to look far out into the gloom of the soft, moist
air. The shrill piping of frogs sounded from the still
banks of the river, while, as the night wind swept across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>the clearing before the doomed defenses, the sullen booming
of Indian drums, and the wild chorus of quavering
yells came ominously to his startled ears. The savages
were holding their war dances around their distant
camp fires, and were preparing for their work of ruin
and destruction upon the following day.</p>

<p>Next morning the sun rose brightly and soon dissolved
the waving mist which hung over the river, disclosing to
the eager eyes of the sentries a fleet of birch-bark
canoes, crossing from the other shore. They seemed
to be heavily laden and moved very slowly through the
water, propelled by two or three warriors in each.
But there were ten or fifteen warriors in every canoe,
lying flat upon their faces, so that their number would
not arouse the suspicions of the keen-eyed English
troops. The frail boats reached the bank behind a
cluster of trees, the warriors sprang out, unnoticed,
upon the shore, and soon the common&mdash;behind the fort&mdash;was
thronged with squaws, children, and braves, some
naked, and others brilliantly painted white, vermilion,
and pale blue. They moved restlessly to and fro,
while many of the savages, wrapped in their blankets,
and holding them close up to their faces, stalked up to
the fort, scowling at the palisades and glowering evilly
at the sentries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the alarmed Major in command of Detroit
had not been idle. The whole garrison was ordered
under arms. Bayonets were placed in the end of the
muskets, revolvers were strapped to waists, powder
horns were filled to the brims. The English fur traders
in the fort closed their storehouses and armed their
men, who, with long flintlocks, scraggy beards, tawny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
hunting shirts, and weather-beaten faces, looked as if
they could put up a very excellent fight. All were cool,
confident, and ready for whatever might transpire.</p>

<p>It was not long before Pontiac, himself, approached
at the head of sixty Indian chiefs, all marching in single
file. They were wrapped to the throat in colored
blankets and some had hawk, eagle, and raven plumes
fluttering from their heads, while others had shaved
their crowns, leaving only a scalp-lock hanging to one
side. Their cheeks were smeared with white lead, soot,
ochre, and vermilion, while their keen, beady eyes
gleamed in their sockets vindictively, and gave them
a grim and horrible aspect. As they crossed the bridge
leading over a creek near by, a Canadian settler, named
Beaufait, met them, and stepped to one side in order
to allow them to pass. This they did, without glancing
at him, but, as the last warrior approached, he recognized
him as an old friend and associate. Uttering a
vindictive "Ugh!" the warrior opened his blanket,
disclosing the hidden gun, and, pointing with his arm to
the fort, showed by a wave of his hand that he meant
to use it with effect upon the English. The Canadian
was too startled to move and stood looking after them,
like a person suddenly paralyzed.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock when the Chief of the Ottawas
reached the fort, and, at his request to be admitted, the
gateway was immediately thrown open to him. In an
instant the cruel traitor was inside the palisade, but, as
his keen eye gazed around him, he started back, and a
deep ejaculation escaped from behind the folds of his
gaudy blanket. The sight that met his eyes might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
well have terrified his crafty soul, for at a glance he saw
that his long-meditated plot was ruined. Ranks of red-coated
soldiers stood upon either side of the gateway,
their guns at parade-rest, and their glittering bayonets
flashing in the rays of the gleaming sun. He pressed
on with his followers, but, as he passed the first house,
he saw the motley collection of fur traders armed to
the teeth, standing upon the corner of the street, and
glowering at him and his warriors like fierce wolf-hounds
on the leash. A drum beat, the soldiers closed the gate
and formed a double line in the rear, but, regaining his
composure, Pontiac strode forward into the narrow
street, while his chiefs, glancing uncertainly from side
to side, marched after their leader to the council chamber.</p>

<p>The council house was a large building near the
river, and, as the Indians entered, they saw Gladwyn,
with several of his officers, seated in readiness to receive
them. The now cautious chiefs could not help seeing
that every British officer had a sword at his side and a
brace of pistols at his belt. Therefore, the red conspirators
began to be afraid, and, eying each other with
uneasy glances, they began to back away towards the
doorway through which they had just entered. But
Pontiac strode before the commandant and spoke with
a loud voice. "Why do I see so many of my father's
young men standing in the street with their guns?"
said he. "Is it for warfare against the French that
they are preparing?"</p>

<p>Gladwyn could not speak the Ottawa tongue, so replied
through his interpreter La Butte.</p>

<p>"I have ordered my soldiers under arms for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of order and discipline," said he. "We are to hold a
parade this afternoon."</p>

<p>Still gazing cautiously around them, the chiefs at
length sat down upon some mats on the floor, and, after
a long pause, in which the pipe of peace was passed
cautiously around, Pontiac arose to address the assembly.
In his right hand was the belt of wampum,
and, as he addressed the officers, assuring them that
he had come only to smoke the pipe of peace and promote
their friendship, the British soldiers kept their
eyes fastened upon it with looks of eager expectation.
Suddenly, he raised the belt as if to give the signal for
attack, and, as he did so, Major Gladwyn motioned
slightly with his hand.</p>

<p>Immediately the roll of a drum sounded from beyond
the doorway, the rattle of muskets and tramp of many
feet reverberated through the silent hall, while the shrill
blast of a bugle woke the echoes of the almost silent
fortification. Pontiac stood as if confounded, and, as
he saw the unruffled brow and keen eye of the British
commandant fixed full upon him, he turned and sat
upon the ground in stupid amazement.</p>

<p>Gladwyn now rose to speak, and, as he did so, his eye
flashed fire and determination. "Friendship and protection
shall be given you as long as you deserve it,
O chiefs," said he, "but as soon as you show that you
are not deserving of our friendship, then you will see
our vengeance. We wish to be at peace with our red
brethren, but, if you injure a single one of our Great
Father's children, then our friendship shall be at an
end, forever." At this he sat down and the council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
closed with a speech by Pontiac in which he said that he
would return in a few days with his squaws and children,
for he wanted them to shake hands with their fathers,
the English. Gladwyn did not make reply to this.
At his command, the gates of the fort were thrown aside,
the cowering savages filed out into the open, and, with
a sigh of relief, the British soldiers mounted the ramparts
and watched their retreating forms as they disappeared
in the distance. The great plot of the crafty
Pontiac had been a complete failure.</p>

<p>Furious with rage and disappointment, the mighty
chief of the Ottawas withdrew to his camp, bitterly
cursing the turn of fortune, but resolved to visit the
English once more, and to convince them if possible that
their suspicions against him were unfounded. So, early
the next day, he came to the fort with three of his chiefs,
bearing in his right hand the sacred calumet or peace
pipe. He was permitted to enter, and, offering it to
Gladwyn and his officers, addressed them as follows:
"My fathers, evil birds have sung lies into your ears.
We that stand before you are friends of the English.
We love them as our brothers, and, to prove our love,
we have come this day to smoke the pipe of peace."
At his departure, he presented the pipe to one of the
British soldiers as a token of his regard, while in the
afternoon the Indians engaged in a game of ball on the
flat plain near the fort. Pontiac went to the Pottawattamie
village and had a long consultation upon
the best method of gaining an entrance to the fort,
for he now saw that the white men had been keen
enough to see through his evil designs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>Early next day the garrison saw the common behind
the fort fairly swarming with Indians, and Pontiac,
advancing from the black crowd of painted warriors, approached
the gate. He walked up to it and attempted
to open the door, but it was fast closed against him.
"Open, open, to me," he shouted to the sentinels, "I
would speak with Major Gladwyn." To this the Major
himself replied, stating that he might enter, if he wished
to, alone, but that the crowd he had brought with him
must remain outside. Intense hatred and malice
shone in the eyes of the Ottawa chief, as he saw that he
could not pass the gates, and, with a fierce gesture of his
arm, he turned abruptly from the palisade and walked
off to his followers, who, in black multitudes, lay upon
the ground just beyond reach of the guns of the bastions.
It was time to throw off the mask of dissimulation.</p>

<p>As the soldiers of the garrison gazed after his retreating
figure, they saw the Indians leap from their positions,
"yelping like a lot of devils," and begin to run, in a
body, towards the house of an old English woman who
lived at a distant part of the common with her family.
With fierce blows of their tomahawks and war clubs
they soon beat down the doors, and, in a moment more,
the long scalp-yell told only too plainly what had been
the fate of the inmates. While this was occurring
another large body ran, whooping and yelping, to the
river bank, and, leaping into their birch-bark canoes,
paddled with speed to an island in the river where lived
an old English sergeant called Fisher. He was soon
routed out of the cellar, where he had taken refuge, was
dragged outside, and murdered. Every Englishman in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the fort, whether officer, trader, or soldier, was now
ordered under arms. Gladwyn, himself, walked the
ramparts throughout the night. He expected an
attack in the morning, and his expectations were fully
realized.</p>

<p>When the sleepy sentinels on the ramparts saw the
first red tinge of dawn tint the hazy east, next morn,
a savage chorus of war whoops arose from every side
of the fort. The men leaped to their posts on the bastion
and behind the loopholes of the palisade, and, as they
did so, a vast swarm of savage warriors&mdash;Wyandots,
Pottawattamies, and Ojibwas&mdash;rushed furiously at the
walls, discharging their guns incessantly, and screeching
like so many wildcats. But, as they came near enough
to be seen, suddenly they scampered behind barns and
fences, skulked behind bushes, or lay flat upon their
stomachs in hollows of the ground. Each&mdash;with a mouth
filled with bullets&mdash;charged and fired recklessly, while
uttering the most blood-curdling yells. They were
naked, painted all colors of the rainbow, and with the
agility of monkeys dodged the shot from the cannon of
the fort. Every loophole was a target for their bullets,
but they were poor shots and hardly ever hit the mark.
The soldiers, on the other hand, took deliberate aim, and
now and again a painted devil would leap high into the
air with a fierce yell of pain, showing that some good,
British lead had taken effect. A host of Indians found
shelter behind a cluster of outbuildings, but a cannon,
loaded with red-hot spikes, was aimed at the strategic
point. The wooden houses were soon in flames, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>savages fled, howling dismally, while the soldiers peppered
them with ball, as they decamped. Gladwyn
walked continually among his men, encouraging them
by word and gesture, while the stern features of Pontiac
could be seen eagerly watching the turn of events from
a hillock in the rear of his barbarous crew.</p>

<p>So the fight waged for six hours, but, as the sun grew
hot overhead, the yelping masses of Indians became
weary of their useless efforts. Gradually their rifle
fire ceased, their war whoops died away, and their
painted bodies began to disappear from the fence rails,
bushes, and houses, which partly hid them from the
eyes of the garrison. Few had been hit by bullets from
the fort, for few had exposed themselves. Among the
garrison only five men had been wounded and these not
seriously. The first honor of the fight for the possession
of Detroit had thus distinctly been with the British
troops, and Major Gladwyn smiled with pleasure as he
gazed out across the river at the clusters of Indian tepees
which sheltered those who were thirsting for his lifeblood
and for that of his men. Provisions were scarce,
but the courage of his soldiers was not lacking, and he
determined to fight to the last ditch rather than to capitulate
to such an enemy.</p>

<p>Still under the impression that the whole affair was a
sudden outbreak of no particular importance, and that
the anger of the Indians would soon subside, Major
Gladwyn, being in great want of provisions, opened
negotiations with the savages, under cover of which
he hoped to smuggle in necessary supplies from the
French Canadians, whom the followers of Pontiac would
not attack. Some of his officers advised him to embark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the troops aboard the two sloops and depart for Niagara,
but to this advice the gallant soldier would not listen.
Three ambassadors were, therefore, sent to the Indian
camp, among whom was a Major Campbell, a brave
and hardy officer. Five or six of the French also went
along.</p>

<p>Pontiac took the ambassadors by the hand and led
them to his camp, where, after a long conference, Campbell
appreciated his danger and asked to be allowed to
retire. "My father," said the Ottawa chief to him,
"you will sleep tonight in the lodges of your red children."
Thus the gallant officer was betrayed into the hands of
the enemy, nor did he ever live to again see the British
garrison, as an Indian warrior murdered him shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>Word was then sent by Pontiac to the fort that the
troops should immediately surrender, lay down their
arms, as their fathers, the French, had been obliged to
do, leave the cannon, magazines, and merchants'
goods, and the two vessels, and be escorted in batteaux
(long boats) by the Indians to Niagara. To this Major
Gladwyn answered that his commanding officer had
not sent him there to deliver up the fort to Indians or
anybody else, and he would, therefore, defend it as long
as a single man could stand at his side. So day after day
the Indians continued their attacks until their shrill
whoops and the rattle of their guns became familiar
sounds. For weeks none of the soldiers lay down to
sleep, except in their clothes, and their guns were always
loaded and standing at their sides. The outbuildings,
which gave shelter to the Indians, were burned down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
by volunteers from the palisades, while orchard trees
and fences were leveled near the fort so that the savage
enemy had no cover to shelter him. Still, worming
themselves along in the grass, the savages would crawl
close to the bastions, and shoot arrows, tipped with
burning tow, upon the roofs of the houses. Tanks of
water were everywhere provided for fire, and, although
the thatched roofs were frequently alight, they were
always extinguished before the blaze had any headway.</p>

<p>Pontiac was furious with anger at not reducing the
fort, and begged the French inhabitants to teach him the
foreign method of making ditches and trenches in order
to approach a fortification, under cover. But the ignorant
Canadians knew nothing of civilized warfare and
could not aid him. One hundred and twenty Ojibwa
warriors now joined the forces of Pontiac and assisted
in the attack, while every man in the fort slept upon the
ramparts, even in the stormiest of weather, and repelled
every attempt of the savages to rush the defenses.</p>

<p>Pontiac had a friend, called Baby&mdash;a French Canadian&mdash;who
lived near by, and, one evening, he entered his
house, seated himself before the fire and looked steadily
at the glowing embers for a long time. At length, raising
his head, he said: "Friend, I have heard that the English
have offered you a bushel of silver for my scalp. Is it
true?" "The story is false," replied the Canadian. "I
will never betray you, for an instant." The Chief of
the Ottawas keenly studied the features of the white
man for a number of minutes. "My brother has spoken
the truth," he said, "and I will show that I believe him
by spending the night at his house." So saying, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
wrapped himself in his blanket, lay down upon a bench,
and slept peacefully until the morning, with perfect
confidence that no harm would be done him; which
proves that, although cruel and vindictive, he had trust
and confidence in his friends.</p>

<p>Another anecdote also shows that his trust in his
friends was sincere and absolute. Shortly after the
beginning of the siege a Captain Rogers came up to
Detroit, with a detachment of troops, and on landing
sent a bottle of brandy, by a friendly Indian, as a present
to Pontiac&mdash;an old-time friend and acquaintance.
The Ottawas were always suspicious that the English
meant to poison them, and so those around the great
chief endeavored to persuade him that the brandy was
drugged. Pontiac quietly listened to what they had
to say, and, as they ceased speaking, replied: "I have
saved this man Rogers' life. No man whose life I have
saved has the power to kill me, for when he and his men
came, not many moons ago, to demand the surrender
of Detroit from the French, I kept my Indians from attacking
him. He knows this." So saying, he immediately
drank the brandy, which, of course, was perfectly
pure, and from which he suffered no evil effects.</p>

<p>Not long after his conversation with the Canadian,
Pontiac discovered that a few of the young Wyandot
braves were stealing his white friend's hogs and cattle,
under cover of the darkness. He consequently decided
to put an end to these depredations, and, arriving at the
white man's home one evening, he walked to and fro,
among the barns and enclosures, waiting for a sight of
the marauders. Nothing occurred until late in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
evening, when, looking keenly through the blackness,
the great Sachem of the Ottawas saw the dark forms of
the thieves stealing through the gloom. At this he
walked up near to them, and thundered in fierce tones:
"Go back to your village, you Wyandot dogs. If you
tread again on this man's land you shall die!" The
Wyandots trembled, and slunk away abashed, while,
from then on, the Canadian's property was no longer
molested. This well illustrates the power which Pontiac
exercised over the minds of his followers.</p>

<p>While perils were thickening around the brave garrison
at Detroit, the allied Indians had, meanwhile, not
been idle. Late one afternoon the soldiers of the garrison
were startled by seeing a naked line of warriors
issuing from the woods near the fort, each painted
black and with a scalp fluttering from the end of a pole.
They dismally howled a death wail and shook their
sticks at the fort, which made it only too clear that some
new disaster had befallen the English. Such was the
truth, for at nightfall a Canadian came to the gate with
tidings that Fort Sandusky had been taken and that all
the garrison there had either been slain or made captive.</p>

<p>It seems that&mdash;on the sixteenth of May&mdash;the commandant
of the Fort (Ensign Paully) had been informed
that seven Indians were at the gate to speak to him, and,
as several of them were known to him, he ordered them
to be admitted. Arriving at his quarters, two of the
visitors seated themselves on either side of him, while the
rest dispersed themselves around the room. Pipes
were lighted, and the conversation began, when an Indian
near the doorway suddenly made a signal with his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
In a moment Paully was captured and bound, while the
entire garrison was shot down. The savages, conducting
him to a canoe, soon set fire to the fort and burned
it to the ground. Paully was adopted by a widow of the
tribe, but subsequently made his escape and joined the
defenders of Detroit.</p>

<p>The port of St. Josephs lay at the mouth of the river
of that name near the head of Lake Michigan, and the
fort, recently abandoned by the French, was garrisoned
by Ensign Schlosser, with a command of fourteen men&mdash;a
mere handful in the heart of a wilderness swarming
with enemies. Thus, when a large force of Pottawattamies
of Detroit came to have a friendly "talk,"
Schlosser was on his guard, for he feared treachery.
But this did him no good. The sentinel at the gate was
tomahawked, the Indians rushed into the fort, eleven
Englishmen were killed, and the rest were made prisoners.
They were conducted to Detroit, where Schlosser
and three soldiers were exchanged for an equal number
of Indian captives who had fallen into the hands of the
garrison. This news was followed by the announcement
that Fort Miami had also capitulated to the Indians,
while painted warriors passing along the opposite bank
in great numbers&mdash;a short time afterwards&mdash;announced
by their yells that Presqu' Isle had also succumbed to
their treachery. Le Boeuf, Venango, and Michillimackinac
likewise capitulated, and only Detroit and Fort
Pitt, in Pennsylvania, held out against the fury of Chief
Pontiac and his confederacy.</p>

<p>The fate of Michillimackinac was particularly depressing,
as the garrison there had been a good one of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
thirty-five men, with their officers. The Commandant&mdash;Captain
Etherington&mdash;had been told by a Canadian
trader that the Indian had formed a design to destroy,
not only his garrison, but all the English on the lakes,
but to this he not only turned a deaf ear, but also
threatened to send prisoner to Detroit the next person
who should disturb him with such tidings. Therefore,
the fate which awaited him could possibly have been
averted had he not shown the same contempt for danger
that lured many an Englishman upon the frontier to
his doom.</p>

<p>The fourth of June was a warm and sultry day, and,
as it was the birthday of King George of England, the
discipline of the garrison was relaxed. Many of the
soldiers were allowed to go outside the palisade, leaving
just enough behind to act as sentinels and patrols in the
fort. Encamped in the woods, not far distant, were a
large number of Ojibwas and Sacs, who, early in the
morning, informed the soldiers that they were to play
a game of <i>baggattaway</i>, or lacrosse. The British were
invited to come out and view the game, and, in consequence,
the fort was soon deserted. Captain Etherington
stood near the gate talking to some Indian chiefs.
The soldiers stood&mdash;for the most part unarmed&mdash;in the
shadow of the palisades, while a number of Indian
squaws, wrapped in blankets, lounged near the entrance
to the fort. Hundreds of lithe warriors rushed about
the plain, with bats in their hands, endeavoring to
catch the ball and hurl it through their adversaries'
goal, while their whoops and yells were mingled with
the cheers of the eager spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the game continued, when suddenly, from the
midst of the multitude, the ball soared into the air, and,
descending in a wide curve, fell near the doorway of the
fort. Immediately the entire mass of whooping savages
had followed it, and, as they dashed to the doorway,
their shrill cries were turned to the death-bringing
war whoop. This was not a hasty assault. It was a
preconceived stratagem to surprise and destroy the
unsuspecting British troops. And, as the ball-players
ran by their women, they snatched the hatchets which
the latter had concealed beneath their blankets. The
startled English had no time to run and seize their
muskets. They were struck down by the infuriated
warriors, butchered upon the spot, and soon the quiet
parade ground was red with the blood of the defenseless
garrison. Thus the fate of Michillimackinac was similar
to that of every other fortification upon the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the garrison at Detroit was eagerly awaiting
the arrival of reinforcements from Fort Niagara.
The siege was being so vigorously pushed that soldiers,
merchants, and servants were upon the ramparts every
night, no one sleeping in a house, except the sick and
wounded in the hospital. Naturally, then, they were
much overjoyed when&mdash;on May 30th&mdash;the English
sentinel on duty announced that a fleet of boats was
coming around the point, at a place called the Huron
Church. The garrison flocked to the bastions, and, for
a moment, hope shone upon the haggard countenances
of all. But, as the boats drew nearer, the Indian death-cry
sounded from them, and they were seen to be full
of painted warriors instead of white troops. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the fact dawned upon the defenders of Detroit&mdash;the
detachment had been captured by the followers of
Pontiac.</p>

<p>This was the truth, for, their approach having been
ascertained by the great leader, he had stationed a body
of warriors to intercept the progress of the relieving
party at Point Pelée. Twenty small batteaux, manned
with a considerable number of soldiers and laden with
stores, landed here in the evening. The Indians watched
their movements from the brush and fell upon them
about daylight. One officer and thirty men escaped
upon the lake, but the others were either killed or captured.
The line of barges ascended the Detroit River
near the opposite shore, escorted by the Indians on the
bank and guarded by detachments in each boat, in full
view of the garrison and of the French settlement
near by.</p>

<p>In the foremost boat were four soldiers and only three
savages, and, as the shallop came opposite the larger of
the two sloops which lay anchored before the fort, the
one who acted as steersman determined to escape. He
called out in English to his companion, who was near one
of the Indians, and told him to throw the Indian overboard.
The soldier answered that he was not strong
enough; whereupon the steersman directed him to
change places with him, as if tired out from rowing, so
that no suspicion would be excited in the minds of the
guard. The soldier who had conceived the plot now
slipped forward, as if to take his companion's oar, but,
instead of doing so, he suddenly seized the Indian by
the hair, and, gripping him by the waist with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
hand, lifted him from the seat and threw him into the
river. As the savage shot out over the gunwale, he
seized fast to the clothes of the soldier, and, drawing himself
up out of the water, stabbed him again and again
with his knife. This knocked the Englishman overboard,
and, holding fast to the redskin, both went down
the current, rising and sinking in the swift tide, and
grappling in the embrace of death. Meanwhile the two
other Indians had leaped out of the boat, while the soldiers
turned about, and pulled for the neighboring vessel,
crying aloud for assistance as they did so. But the Indians
in the other canoes came after them in hot pursuit,
while the followers of Pontiac on the bank kept up a rapid
fire upon them with their muskets. It seemed as if they
must be captured, for the bullets hissed about their heads
and the birch-bark canoes gained upon them with every
thrust of the paddle. Escape seemed impossible, when
suddenly a cannon blazed from the side of the vessel, and
a ball, flying past the boat, just escaped hitting the foremost
canoe. This was enough for the Indians. They
withdrew in fear and dismay; while a second ball, exploding
among the warriors on the shore, made them
take to the bushes. With a few lusty heaves the soldiers
reached the side of the vessel where they were warmly
greeted, as men coming from the jaws of death, and as a
living monument to the old adage that "Fortune favors
the brave." Lest the other prisoners might escape, they
were immediately landed by the Indians, and were
marched to a point well beyond the view of the garrison
at Detroit. In the morning their scarred and mutilated
bodies began to float by the fort, on the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
water, warning the soldiers what would be their fate,
should they fail to hold out against the ferocious warriors
of Pontiac's Confederacy.</p>

<p>During the month of June another attempt to relieve
the garrison proved to be more successful than the last.
One of the two vessels, anchored near the fort, had been
sent to Niagara for men and for supplies. She had a
safe passage, and, before long, arrived at the mouth of
the river with about fifty soldiers on board, and a goodly
supply of stores. The Indians saw her coming up the
stream, realized that they must sink her if they could,
and consequently surrounded her in their canoes and
pumped lead at her sides, as if they hoped to scuttle her
with bullet holes. But the vessel kept on, until it
reached a very narrow part of the river where the wind
died away, and so the anchor was dropped. Immediately
above this place the Indians had made a breastwork
of logs, carefully concealed in the bushes, and behind
this they lay in force, waiting for the schooner to
pass. This the crew were not aware of, but, from the
moment the sun went down, they kept a keen watch
upon the waters of the river.</p>

<p>Hours passed, the rapid current gurgled about the
bow of the trim little vessel, and on either side frogs
croaked from the black shores of the stream. Occasionally
a night heron squawked in the marshy land
near by, but nothing else disturbed the peace and quiet
of the night. Suddenly the sentry started to his feet, for
dark forms were seen moving upon the surface of the
stream. "Indians! Indians!" he whispered, and, in a
moment, the decks were crowded with soldiers, armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to the teeth. Meanwhile hundreds of canoes crept towards
the vessel, and were within a few rods of their
fancied prize, when a blow from a hammer sounded upon
the foremast of the British boat. It was the signal to
fire. Immediately a dull roar sounded through the still
night, the sides of the vessel burst into a blaze of sheeted
flame, and grape and musket shot tore into the clustering
line of canoes. Fierce yells of pain and chagrin welled
into the air as canoe after canoe sank before the fusillade,
and, with fourteen of their number dead and dying, the
remaining braves turned about and fled precipitously.
But their friends opened a brisk fire from their log
breastwork, so the vessel weighed anchor and dropped
down stream with the current. When it again threw
out the chain and swivel, not an Indian was to be seen.</p>

<p>For six days the vessel had to remain where she was,
until a wind sprang up which was sufficiently strong to
blow her up stream. So sails were hoisted and she
tacked between the shores until the fort was reached.
As she passed the Wyandot village the guns were brought
to bear upon the wigwams, a shower of grapeshot was
fired among them, and, before the yelling savages
were fully aware of the nearness of the schooner, many
of them had been struck down. The rest ran off, yelping
like a band of those cur-dogs which follow every Indian
encampment, and quickly scurried to the protection of
the forest, while the welcome vessel furled her sails
abreast of the fort and came peacefully to anchor.
She brought much-needed ammunition and supplies,
and the tidings that peace had, at last, been declared between
France and England. This was heartily cheered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
by the brave defenders of Detroit, for now, with fresh
supplies, more soldiers, and the renewed confidence
which these could bring, they looked more cheerfully
into the future. They were still in grave peril, and
brave Major Gladwyn still counselled his men to use
every care in watching the savages, both by night and
by day, for their death chants sounded from the edge
of the forest most ominously.</p>

<p>As Pontiac watched the frowning palisades which
he could not subdue, his heart was black with anger.
"You must destroy those boats of the English," said he
to his followers. "When they are gone, we can starve
the white men out; but we must sink or burn them."
So the Ottawas speedily constructed a raft formed of
two boats, secured together with a rope and filled with
pitch pine, birch bark, and other easily lighted wood.
This they set on fire, on the night of the tenth of July,
and shoving it well out into the current with their
canoes, watched it as it floated down upon the schooners,
anchored before the fort. The soldiers saw the blazing
peril as it journeyed slowly towards them and prepared
themselves with boat hooks, oars, and buckets, to meet
it, but a fortunate gust of wind blew the burning pile out
into the stream, and it sailed by the two vessels, well
beyond their bowsprits. A cheer went up from those
upon the decks as the sputtering, gleaming mass floated
slowly out of harm's way, lighting up the shores with an
ominous and sinister glare, plainly revealing the white
houses of the Canadian settlers on the banks. Far
down the stream the fire was extinguished with a dull
and sickening hiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>But this was not the only attempt which the Indians
made to put an end to the two schooners, for, upon the
morning of July twelfth, the sentinel on duty saw a
glowing spark of fire on the surface of the river, and soon
another blazing raft bore down upon the vessels and their
startled crews. The men watched the oncoming blaze
with no particular terror, as they knew that they could
push aside the burning logs with sticks and boat hooks,
but they had no necessity to do this, as the raft was
driven over towards the fort by the swift current, and
glided swiftly by, lighting up the dark shores as it
did so, disclosing the dusky forms of many naked
spectators who stood there, expectantly awaiting the
burning of the hated vessels. A gunner trained one of
the cannon upon them in the bright light. Suddenly,
with a deep boom, an iron ball crashed among the followers
of Pontiac, who, with wild yells of defiance,
dashed into the brush. The soldiers laughed derisively
as their forms retreated into the gloom and burst into a
song of jollification as the raft burned to the water's
edge and the last gleaming spark was extinguished by
the black waters of the rushing stream.</p>

<p>Soon after the failure of this affair, the savages were
busily seen constructing another raft of larger dimensions.
The gallant Major in charge of Detroit was now
determined to protect his vessels from further harm,
and so procured a number of boats which he moored
across the stream with hawsers, at some distance above
the schooners, so that if any rafts should drop down the
river they would lodge against these before they struck
the sides of the two vessels. When the followers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Pontiac saw this they were very angry and it is said that
they stood upon the shores and shook their clenched
fists vindictively at the soldiers, for they now saw that
their attempts to burn the vessels would be fruitless.
Pontiac, himself, was somewhat disheartened at the turn
which affairs were taking, but his heart was cheered, a
few days later, by the appearance of an Abenaki brave
from lower Canada who told him that the King of France&mdash;the
Indians' Great Father&mdash;was advancing up the
St. Lawrence River with a large and formidable army.
This untruth was believed by the leader of the uprising,
and, when a body of Wyandot warriors came in, not long
afterwards, with the news that every English fortification,
save that of Fort Du Quesne, had fallen before
the onslaughts of the savages, the heart of Pontiac was
glad, and he bitterly upbraided his own followers for not
having sufficient courage to subdue the handful of Englishmen
and trappers in Detroit.</p>

<p>Really the Indians had done well, for they had persisted
in the siege for two full months, which was an
extraordinarily long time for savages to remain constant
to anything. Their usual method was to make a quick
attack and to then retreat, if unsuccessful. Yet here&mdash;under
guidance of the Great Pontiac&mdash;they had steadily
persevered in hemming in the doughty garrison for a
long and tedious period of from between two to three
months. The only way in which they could possibly
subdue the English would be by scaling the palisades,
and, although they twice attempted this feat, none had
the courage to complete the task after the garrison began
to pour hot volleys into the ranks of the attackers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Pontiac, himself, should have led the advance, but even
he did not have sufficient nerve to mount the log breastworks
of Detroit.</p>

<p>What the spirit of the doughty Gladwyn was on this
occasion is easily seen from the following letter. On
July the ninth he wrote to a friend in the East, and
his missive was carried past the Indians by a trusty
scout.</p>

<p>"You have long ago heard of our pleasant situation.
Was it not very agreeable to hear every day of the
savages cutting, carving, boiling, and eating our companions?
To see every day dead bodies floating down
the river, mangled and disfigured? But Britons, you
know, never shrink; we always appeared gay, to spite the
rascals. They boiled and ate Sir Robert Deras, and we
are informed by Mr. Paully, who escaped the other day
from one of the stations&mdash;surprised at the breaking out
of the war, and commanded by himself&mdash;that he had seen
an Indian have the skin of Captain Robertson's arm for
a tobacco pouch.</p>

<p>"Three days ago, a party of us went to demolish a
breastwork they had made. We finished our work and
were returning home, but the fort espying a party of
Indians coming up, as if they intended to fight, we were
ordered back, made our dispositions, and advanced
briskly. Our front was fired upon warmly and we
returned the fire for about five minutes. In the meantime,
Captain Hobkins, with about twenty men, filed
off to the left, and about twenty French volunteers filed
off to the right, and got between them and their fires.
The villains immediately fled, and we returned, as was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>prudent; for a sentry I had placed behind me informed
me that he saw a body of them coming down the woods,
and our party, being about eighty, was not able to cope
with their united bands. In short, we beat them
handsomely, and yet did not much hurt to them, for
they ran extremely well. We only killed their leader
and wounded three others. One of them fired at me
at the distance of fifteen or twenty paces, but I suppose
my terrible visage made him tremble. I think I shot
him."</p>

<p>Gladwyn says: "Britons, you know, never shrink,"
and, in this one phrase lies the secret of the white man's
success against the redskins. For, with order, knowledge
of firearms, the construction of fortifications,
houses, and redoubts, and obedience to the commands
of their officers, this mere handful of soldiers had been
able to stand off the overwhelming masses of the enemy
with apparent ease. Then, too, combined with a knowledge
of fighting, they possessed the spirit which "never
shrank." Their hearts were big with courage&mdash;that
courage for which the Britons have always been noted:
that bulldog courage which carried them up the sides
of Bunker Hill right into the bullets of the American
forces, although they could have easily conquered their
opponents by an advance upon the right flank; that
resolution which later on was to sacrifice numberless
brave men at Modder River and Spion Kop in South
Africa needlessly, and, to our way of thinking, unintelligently.
For here, as at Bunker Hill, red-coated
and tartaned British soldiers marched courageously
and firmly, straight up to the breastworks of the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
there to be mown down by thousands, when a flanking
movement could easily have dislodged the foe. One
cannot fail to admire such bravery, for, like Burnsides'
frontal attack at Fredericksburg during the Civil War
in America, such courage is great and awe-inspiring,
but ill-advised. We are thrilled by it, yet we cannot
applaud.</p>

<p>While the siege progressed at Detroit, a force gathered
at Niagara to relieve the garrison, and, in the meanwhile,
the Indians made a violent and fierce attack upon
the fortifications upon the New York and Pennsylvania
frontier. Fort Le Boeuf and Fort Venango fell before
the wiles of the savages and only their smouldering
ruins marked where traders, soldiers, homesteaders,
and red men had once congregated in apparent peace
and good will. At Fort Pitt (formerly Fort Du Quesne),
every preparation was made for an attack from the
Indians.</p>

<p>This formidable stockade (where now is the city of
Pittsburg) had three hundred and thirty soldiers,
traders, and hardy backwoodsmen in the garrison, with
numbers of women and children. In command was
Captain Simeon Ecuyer, a brave Swiss officer who had
enlisted with the British and who was as doughty a
warrior as the stubborn Gladwyn,&mdash;and with an equal
contempt for the red men. "I believe from what I
hear that I am surrounded by Indians," he wrote to his
commanding officer in the settlements, two hundred
miles away. "I tremble for our outposts. I neglect
nothing to give them a good reception, and I expect
to be attacked tomorrow morning. Please God I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
be, I am fairly well prepared. Everybody is at work,
and I do not sleep; but I tremble lest my messenger
should be cut off." Well might he tremble, for the
Tuscaroras and the Delawares were gathering in force
to attack the fort, burn it to the ground, and, if possible,
to massacre the captured garrison. Rumors of terrible
outrages upon the settlers came hourly to the ears of
the startled soldiers. Men, women and children flocked
to the protection of the walls of the fort, while it became
dangerous to venture outside the palisades, as the few
who did were shot and scalped by lurking Indians. All
night the savages fired upon the sentinels, and soon
during the day no one dared to put his head above the
rampart, because of the hidden redskins on the edge
of the forest. It was apparent that the surrounding
woods were full of Indians, whose numbers daily increased,
though they made no attempt at a general
attack upon the frowning log walls of Fort Pitt, where,
with courage, cheer, and resolution, those within waited
for the onslaught which they knew to be at hand.</p>

<p>Finally, on a bright June day, numbers of painted
warriors appeared in the cleared lands behind the fort,
drove off the horses which were grazing there, killed a
herd of cattle belonging to the soldiers, and then began
a hot fire at the stockades, which soon broke with a dull
roar from every thicket of the forest. In reply, the
garrison turned some howitzers upon the woodland,
touched them off, and, as the iron shells burst in the
dense underbrush with a loud and ominous report, the
frightened red men could be seen scurrying out of
harm's way, in every direction. The day wore to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
close, and, as darkness settled upon the forest, the flashes
from the guns of the Indians grew less; gradually their
weird war whoops melted away, and in their place
sounded the shrill piping of frogs. As darkness came,
occasionally the sharp crack of a rifle warned the sentinels
on the ramparts that the savages were still upon
the alert.</p>

<p>Next morning gallant Ecuyer was watching the woodland
through a glass, when several painted warriors
strode from the shade of the trees to the ditch beyond
the palisades. One of them stepped forward, and,
proclaiming that he was a great chief of the Delawares
called Turtle's Heart, addressed the garrison with the
following words:</p>

<p>"My brothers, we that stand here are your friends;
but we have bad news to tell you. Six great nations
of Indians have taken up the hatchet, and have cut off
all the English garrisons, excepting yours. They are
now on their way to destroy you also.</p>

<p>"My brothers, we are your friends, and we wish to
save your lives. What we desire you to do is this:
You must leave this fort, with all your women and
children, and go down to the English settlements, where
you will be safe. There are many bad Indians already
here, but we will protect you from them. You must go
at once, because if you wait till the six nations arrive
here, you will all be killed, and we can do nothing to
protect you."</p>

<p>Certainly this was a bold proposal to an old warhorse
like Ecuyer, and, like a true English bulldog, he
voiced a reply which made the Indians wince. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
spoke in loud and eloquent tones, so that all could not
fail to hear him.</p>

<p>"My brothers," said he, "we are very grateful for
your kindness, though we are convinced that you must
be mistaken in what you have told us about the forts
being captured. As for ourselves, we have plenty of
provisions, and are able to keep the fort against all the
nations of Indians that may dare to attack it. We are
very well off in this place, and we mean to stay here.</p>

<p>"My brothers, as you have shown yourselves such
true friends, we feel bound in gratitude to inform you
that an army of six thousand English will shortly arrive
here, and that another army of three thousand is gone
up the lakes to punish the Ottawas and Ojibwas. A
third has gone to the frontiers of Virginia, where they
will be joined by your enemies, the Cherokees and
Catawbas, who are coming here to destroy you. Therefore,
take pity on your women and children, and get out
of the way as soon as possible. We have told you this
in confidence, out of our great solicitude lest any of you
should be hurt, and we hope that you will not tell the
other Indians, lest they should escape from our vengeance."</p>

<p>At the close of this speech the Indians withdrew, but
it could be easily seen that the tale of the approach of
the three armies had the desired effect, for the faces of
some of the braves showed fear and consternation.
Next day most of the savages moved away from the
neighborhood and marched to meet a great body of
warriors who were advancing from the westward to
make an attack upon the fort, while the garrison labored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
with vim to make the palisades shot proof, to fill up a
part of the palisades which had fallen into the ramparts,
and to construct a fire engine, so that any flames which
came from the burning arrows of the Indians could be
extinguished with ease. But for several weeks no attacks
came from the skulking foes, although they frequently
appeared in the vicinity of the stockade and
fired random shots at the sentinels. All communication
was cut off with the settlements, and the soldiers nerved
themselves for the coming affray which they knew would
be a desperate affair.</p>

<p>Finally, on the twenty-sixth of July, a small party
of Indians approached the gate bearing a flag of truce,
and requesting that they be admitted. They were
brought inside, and again&mdash;in a long and pompous
address&mdash;requested the English to withdraw, or they
would be overwhelmed by the attack of their own
braves, assisted by Pontiac's Ottawas. But, although
listening to them with respect, Ecuyer was not to be
frightened by savage bravado. "I have warriors,
ammunition, and provisions enough to defend this place
for three years" he replied, "and against all the Indians
on earth. We shall not abandon Fort Pitt as
long as a white man lives in America. I despise the
Ottawas of Pontiac, and am very much surprised at
our brothers, the Delawares, for proposing to us to leave
this place and go home. This is our home. You have
attacked us without reason or provocation. You have
murdered and plundered our warriors and traders;
you have taken our horses and cattle; and at the same
time you tell us that your hearts are good towards your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
brethren, the English. How can I have faith in you?
Therefore, now, brothers, I will advise you to go home
to your towns and to take care of your wives and children.
Moreover, I tell you that if any of you appear
again about this fort, I will throw bombshells, which
will burst and blow you to atoms, and I will fire a
cannon among you loaded with a whole bag full of
bullets. Therefore, take care, for I don't want to
hurt you."</p>

<p>The chiefs departed, glowering with anger and hatred,
and bitterly disappointed in not gaining a bloodless
possession of the fort, while the men of the garrison
nerved themselves for the impending attack. On the
night succeeding the conference it came. At dusk, dark
forms could be seen stealing from the edge of the woodland.
Hundreds of savages crawled as noiselessly as
possible towards the log stockade, many of them dropping
down behind the banks of the river and digging
holes in the earth with their knives, so that they could
be sheltered from the bullets from the fort. Silently
and surely they made their line around the palisades,
and, when the first flush of dawn reddened the East, a
wild war whoop announced that the attack was to begin.
Immediately a gruelling fire was opened upon the silent
walls of Fort Pitt, bullets and arrows flew thick and fast
into the palisades, but hiding behind the stout log
breastwork, the garrison paid little heed to the rain of
shot and other missiles. Occasionally a red man would
expose his head from one of the holes in the bank, whereupon
a dozen rifles would speak from the stockade, and
as many bullets would whizz past the ears of the wily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
brave. Several were hit and died where they fell, and,
although the Royal American troops had on the customary
red uniforms which offered a bright mark to the
Indians, not a single one was killed. Ecuyer ran among
his men, exhorting them to do their best, and himself
firing a rifle from the ramparts at the screeching savages.
In broken English he was yelling defiance at the redskins,
when an arrow hit him in the leg and pierced
him through. Pulling it out immediately, he continued
to direct the fire of his own men with as much spirit as
before, and, when approached by the backwoodsmen
with the request that they be allowed to make a sortie
against the foe, called out with much spirit: "Allow you
to go outside, my hearties? No, by Heaven, you are too
valuable to me to permit me to risk even one of your
necks in the open. Fight here, my boys, and we'll
make good my boast to the redskins that I can hold
this fort against all the Indians in the woods. Lie low,
shoot straight, and when you see an Indian's head be sure
that you hit it." As he ceased speaking a burning
arrow flew into the stockade and ignited the roof of one
of the houses, while the women and children&mdash;much
terrified&mdash;rushed into the street with wails of distress.
The savages fairly howled with joy when they saw the
flames burst from the thatched roof, but water from
the fire engine quickly put out the blaze, and, as several
of the Indians exposed themselves in order to fire more
arrows into the fort, they were killed by well-directed
volleys of the Royal Americans. As darkness shut
down upon the first day of fighting, there had been
nothing accomplished by the besiegers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>For five days the redskins continued their screeching,
howling, and desultory firing upon the palisades. As
at Detroit, they did not have the heart to rush the stockade,
and, as at Detroit, their irregular attack did little
damage. The troops enjoyed the fun, shot carefully
and did some damage. "The redskins were well under
cover and so were we," wrote the gallant Ecuyer to
Sir Geoffrey Amherst. "They did us no harm: nobody
killed, seven wounded, and I, myself, slightly. Their
attack lasted five days and five nights. We are certain
of having killed and wounded twenty of them, without
reckoning those we could not see die. I let nobody fire
until he had marked his man; and not an Indian could
show his nose without being pricked with a bullet, for
I have some good shots here. Our men are doing admirably,
regulars and the rest. All that they ask
is to go out and fight. I am fortunate to have the
honor of commanding such brave men. I only wish the
Indians had ventured an assault. They would have
remembered it to the thousandth generation.
I forgot to tell you that they threw fire-arrows to burn
our works, but they could not reach the buildings, nor
even the rampart. Only two arrows came into the
fort, one of which had the insolence to make free with
my left leg."</p>

<p>On the sixth day of the attack, suddenly the men of
the garrison saw the Indians crawling out of their burrows
in the river bank and running away to the woods.
As they moved off they were peppered by the shots of
the backwoodsmen and Royal Americans, who knocked
over two half-clad braves as they leaped from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>waters of the river. Heavy firing could be heard to the
southwest, which lasted for a short time only. Then
wild yells sounded from the forest which seemed deeper
and more human than those of the redskins. Brave
Ecuyer jumped to the top of the stockade with a glass
in his hand and eagerly scanned the edge of the timber,
and, as he did so, a loud cheer arose from the defenders
of Fort Pitt, for, bursting into the open, came
the red coats of British soldiers, the tartans and plaids
of Highlanders, the fringed buckskin shirts of Virginia
rangers, and a torn and battered rag of a flag, half shot
away from the pole to which it was fastened. The
doors of the fort were thrown wide open, the defenders
made a rush for the oncoming army of deliverance, and,
before very many moments the men of Colonel Bouquet's
army&mdash;for such they were&mdash;were being clasped
in the arms of the rough soldiers who had held the
stockade at Fort Pitt. A mighty cheer welled into the
clear air, women cried, children laughed, and the doughty
Ecuyer was seen to dance a cantata on the walls of the
stockade, for the garrison was saved, and the power
of Pontiac in Pennsylvania was irrevocably broken.</p>

<p>This little force which had come to succor the beleaguered
garrison on the Allegheny had just been
through one of the stiffest fights in the annals of Indian
warfare. Colonel Bouquet had marched from Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, a town which was filled with refugees
from the outlying districts, ravaged by the friends and
allies of Pontiac. His total numbers did not exceed
five hundred men, and they were unused to frontier
warfare, although he himself had served for seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
years on the border and knew how to fight a redskin
and how to give him measure for measure. When
they reached Fort Ligonier&mdash;forty-five miles from Fort
Pitt&mdash;a crowd of Indians, who were besieging the place,
vanished into the depths of the wood, and the small
garrison was overjoyed to be suddenly relieved from
a siege which had lasted over a month. They had heard
nothing of Fort Pitt, so, fearing that the oxen and
wagons would be greatly in the way should he be suddenly
attacked, Bouquet left them behind him, and
pressed onward to the banks of a stream called Bushy
Run. The forest was deep, vast, impenetrable, wild,
and rugged boulders impeded the progress of the hardy
troops. They marched compactly with scouts on either
flank to warn them of any lurking foe, and a number
of backwoodsmen thrown well out to the front and to
the rear. Before them was Turtle Creek, a stream
flowing at the bottom of a deep hollow, flanked by steep
precipices, where an ambuscade could be most effective;
and, fearing this, Bouquet decided to camp at Bushy
Run and to pass through this gorge during the night,
when the savages could not see how to make a formidable
attack. So the men pressed cautiously on, feeling their
way and ever ready for a brush with the lurking foe. It
was soon to come.</p>

<p>At one o'clock that day, when the little force was
within half a mile of Bushy Run, a rifle shot sounded
through the stillness of the forest, and a wild yell far
to the front was followed by that volley for which the
English had been waiting during every hour of the past
week. A rattle of musketry and a round British cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
showed that the guard had been furiously attacked,
so the foremost companies were at once ordered
to rush forward and aid the backwoodsmen of the
advance. As they fixed bayonets for the assault, a
tremendous volley warned Bouquet that the enemy were
there in numbers. The troops were, therefore, halted,
formed in line, and ordered to charge with the bayonet.
With a wild cheer they bore down through the forest, ran
into a band of yelping redskins, and drove them, "screeching
like wildcats," into the dim forest. But as this
foe vanished, a tremendous yelling and firing was heard
upon either flank, while cheers, shots, and war whoops in
the rear showed that the entire force was attacked,
and that&mdash;if not protected&mdash;the horses would be stampeded.
So, turning about, the Highlanders and backwoodsmen
hastened to form a circle around the terrified
animals, while from all sides wild cries and yells showed
that a vast number of Pontiac's allies were thirsting
for their life blood. But steady, firm, and resolute, the
Regulars crouched upon one knee; hid behind trees
and logs; carefully aimed at the puffs of smoke which
issued from the underbrush, and cheerfully awaited
the charge of the savages; while Bouquet&mdash;in the centre&mdash;urged
them with voice and gesture to be calm, to take
certain aim, and to make every bullet count.</p>

<p>The Indians did not content themselves with remaining
hidden within the dark brush and shadows of the
forest. Suddenly a considerable body of them charged
furiously upon the British line, holding their knives
and tomahawks ready for a close encounter. But they
were met by a gruelling volley, and with the cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
"No quarter!" the Highlanders charged with fixed
bayonets and drove the whooping warriors into the
forest, where they scampered away like deer. Few
of them were either shot or stabbed, while over fifty
of the English were soon writhing upon the ground
with severe wounds from bullets and arrows. Again
and again the red men thus charged; again and
again they were repulsed; while the hoarse shouts of
the sturdy backwoodsmen were mingled with the bloodthirsty
whoops of the Indian braves, the rattle of
musketry, the screams of the wounded, and the snorting
of the terrified horses. Twilight came, but the red men
and white still fought on in the forest, and only night
with its blackness put an end to this furious fight in
the wilderness. The combatants parted only to sleep
upon their arms, and wait for the renewal of the struggle
which the first flush of daylight was again to bring.</p>

<p>The watchful sentries of the English camp no sooner
saw the dim red light of dawn in the far east than
hideous and awe-inspiring whoops arose from all sides
of the British camp. The English soldiers sprang to
their guns, and it was not a moment too soon, for,
with a thundering roar, a volley was poured in upon
them. Under cover of the trees and bushes the enemy
crept up close to where courageous Bouquet stood in
the centre of his men, crying to them to fight the red
men as they themselves fought: to crouch behind logs,
boulders, bushes, and to shoot with the greatest accuracy.
Terrible thirst beset the English, for no water
was at hand and they could not reach the stream near
by, while the groans of the wounded stirred the savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to renewed vigor in the assault. Again and again the
English charged, but the Indians vanished into the brush
like serpents, and reappeared to the onslaught just as
soon as the Highlanders and backwoodsmen had reformed
their line. The redskins redoubled their yells
and saw the horses plunging and rearing to gain their
freedom from behind a wall of flour bags, which also
sheltered the wounded, and aiming at them, endeavored
to stampede the entire herd. This had its effect.
Many maddened brutes broke away from their halters,
galloped through the ring of kneeling troops and yelping
Indians, and rushed madly into the forest, sweating
with fear and terror. The savages yelled with pleasure
at this and taunted the troops in broken English from
behind the shelter of trees and boulders, saying, "We
got you! We got you!"</p>

<p>The fight had now waged from daylight until ten
o'clock, and there was a lull in the battle&mdash;a lull which
allowed Bouquet to perfect a plan for drawing the
Indians into an ambuscade, which he hoped would finish
the affair. This was: to allow two companies on the
centre of the line to fall back and swing around to the
left, behind some thick brush where they could not be
seen. The place vacated by them was not to be filled
up, and thus the British commander hoped to entice
the Indians into the gap in his line. When they had
come well inside, the two companies which had retreated
were to close in upon their rear, and then hem them in
so that they could be slaughtered. At the word of
command, the two companies fell back and disappeared
from view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>When the savages saw this retreat, they were sure
that they at last had the British on the run, and so
pressed onward with loud and exultant yells of defiance.
A thin line of troops had filled up the gap in
the line, and these were pushed back towards the interior
of the camp, while the Indians seemed to be about to break
into the very heart of the circle. With wild, hilarious
yelpings they ran headlong into the gap, but, as they
did so, the two companies which had retreated broke
from the cover of the bushes which had hidden them,
and bore down upon their rear with yells as fierce as
those of the men of the forest. The Indians faced about
with great courage and fired into the oncoming mass of
men, but the Highlanders fell upon them with the
bayonet. Nothing could stand such an attack; the
red warriors broke and fled, while two companies which
had advanced from their position in the line and had
lain down upon the ground, poured a murderous fire into
them as they passed. Numbers fell to the ground in
their death agony. The remainder fled precipitously,
while the four companies united and chased them
furiously through the woods. Seeing which, the remaining
Indians gave up all hope of success against the
stalwart British, and, with one parting volley and yell of
defiance, they, too, melted away into the forest. The
fight at Bushy Run was over. About sixty Indian
corpses lay upon the ground, among which were those
of several chiefs, while eight English officers and one
hundred and fifteen men had breathed their last amidst
the dark forests of Pennsylvania. Next day the victorious
troops marched onward to the relief of Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Pitt&mdash;with their wounded upon litters&mdash;and, although
frequently attacked by small bands of savages, reached
there without further loss or mishap.</p>

<p>At far-away Detroit the siege went merrily on, but a
detachment of three hundred regular troops was hastening
to its relief. On July the 26th the seasoned veterans
of this remarkable siege were overjoyed to see the red
coats of their brethren-in-arms as they silently entered
the fort, after coming down the river under cover of
the night. This was fortunate, for so bold had Pontiac's
warriors become that it would have fared ill with them
had they advanced by daylight. Commanded by
Dalzell, a brave and courageous man, the detachment
was composed of seasoned British soldiers and twenty
independent forest rangers, who were so anxious to get
at the enemy that arrangements were immediately made
for an attack upon Pontiac. But by some unknown
means this arch-conspirator and Napoleonic designer
of the movement against the English learned of the
plan, and not only removed the women and children
from his camp, but stationed two strong parties of his
warriors in an ambuscade, behind piles of cord-wood
which lay on either side of the road that the English
had to take. Three hundred of the British left the
fort about an hour before day, and marched rapidly
up the bank of the stream in the direction of the Ottawa
camp. They proceeded in silence until they reached a
small bridge over a stream called Bloody Run, and were
half way across it before they knew that the Indians had
the slightest suspicion of their approach. Suddenly
terrific yells burst from their front and a roar of musketry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
sounded in their ears from the high banks on either
side. Half the advance party fell in their tracks,
while the rest turned to run, but Dalzell raised his
voice above the uproar, rushed to the front, sword in
hand, and led on his men. They pushed across the
bridge, and ran up the banks, but not an Indian was
in sight. In vain the British looked for them&mdash;they
had fled&mdash;but in the murk of the early morn their
guns flashed from behind outhouses and fences, while
fierce war cries rose with vigor and intensity. Again
and again the soldiers advanced, but it was useless,
and so, abandoning all idea of a successful attack upon
Pontiac's camp, they retreated to the stockade at
Detroit, fired at all the way and presenting somewhat
the same appearance as Lord Percy's troops in the
retreat from Lexington some years later, at the outbreak
of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>As the soldiers were retreating before the warriors
of Pontiac, Dalzell used every effort to restore order,
and at last succeeded in doing so. The Indians had taken
possession of a house, near the road, from the windows
of which they fired down upon the English; so some of
the rangers broke down the door with an axe, rushed in,
and drove the redskins away. A captain was ordered
to drive off some braves from behind some neighboring
fences, and, as he charged them with his company, he
fell, mortally wounded, shouting: "On, on, England
forever!" The Indians ran off, but no sooner had the
men turned about than the savages came running in
upon the flank and rear, cutting down the stragglers
with their tomahawks and scalping all who fell. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Sergeant of the 55th Regiment lay helplessly wounded,
and realizing that he soon would be scalped, he gazed
with a look of despair after his comrades as they made
off. This caught the eye of warm-hearted Dalzell.
So&mdash;with the true spirit of a hero&mdash;he ran over to the
wounded man to pull him away out of danger, where he
could be carried to the fort. But as he leaned over
him, a rifle shot sounded through the dense mist which
shrouded the battle field, and he fell dead across the
body of the disabled private. Few saw him struck, and
no one dared to turn back to recover his body, and
thus, deserted and alone, the brave Englishman lay
upon the field of battle to be scalped and plundered by
the exultant savages.</p>

<p>This was the last important event attending the remarkable
siege of Detroit. Winter was approaching,
the Indians had nothing laid by which could sustain
them through the winter, and so they had to repair into
the forests in order to trap, hunt, and fish. When
spring arrived, the various bands, as they came in to see
the great chief Pontiac, told him that they were tired
of the war and that they wished for peace. The Hurons
and Pottawattamies, who had partly been forced into
the war by threats of the followers of Pontiac, withdrew
altogether, and thus completely ruined the ambitions
of the great Ottawa chief, who had been so sure
of success that he had already made arrangements with
the French of dividing the conquered territory with
them. The garrison at Detroit still watched his movements
with anxiety. "'Tis said that Pontiac has gone
to the Mississippi, but we don't believe it," wrote one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of the soldiers at this time, and so constant watch and
guard was kept up within the palisades which had
successfully defied the might of the cruel leader of the
conspiracy. He was still near by; no one dared to
venture far into the wilderness; and there was constant
dread of a fresh assault.</p>

<p>But the reign of terror was drawing to its close, and
when, in the early summer of 1764, General Bradstreet
arrived with a force of three thousand men, all the tribes
in the vicinity of Detroit came in and concluded a
peace, with the exception of the fierce Delawares and
Shawnees, who had so unsuccessfully besieged the
ramparts of Fort Pitt. Pontiac, himself, took no part
in the council and was no longer seen. He abandoned
both the country and his followers, and, according to
report, went far to the southwest to the territory of
the Illinois. Here, nursing in silence his wrath, resentment,
and mortification, he brooded upon his fate,
and contemplated a fresh outbreak against the English,
trusting that the tribes in the vicinity of the Illinois
River&mdash;the St. Josephs, the Miamis, the Marcontens,
the Pians, and the Illinois&mdash;would be sufficiently
strong to cope with the force and intelligence of
the British. His plot against Detroit had been a complete
failure. True&mdash;the smaller forts upon the frontier
had fallen before the unexpected assaults of his allies&mdash;but
the great prize, Detroit, had slipped his grasp.
Now a large garrison was there, his Indians were starved
and awed into submission. Fort Pitt still frowned
down from its height in perpetual menace to his allies,
and rumors of an advance upon the warlike Delawares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and Shawnees filled him with chagrin and mortification.
His confederacy was fast breaking.</p>

<p>And the advance came. The brave and hardy
Bouquet with an army of Pennsylvania rangers, Virginia
trappers, and regular troops, pushed far into the
country of the warlike Delawares in the valley of the
Ohio. Reaching a spot in the very heart of the Indian
country, he erected a stout palisade, and awaited a
deputation from the fierce enemies of the Pennsylvania
frontier. All the villages of the Shawnees were within
a few days' march, so no choice was left to the Indian
warriors but to sue for peace or else battle with a man,
who, at the desperate encounter of Bushy Run, had
routed their entire force of fighting braves, with an
army one-third the size of that which he now had with
him. Bouquet meant business, and the Indians knew it.
The frontiersmen were tired of scalpings, burnings, and
robberies on the border. They had marched out to
conclude a treaty of perpetual peace, or to give these
wild rangers of the forest such a beating that they would
remember it forever. Confident in their strength and
the justice of their cause, they awaited the advent of
the Indian Chiefs, with rifles loaded, bullet pouches
well filled, and spirits fired with hatred for the cruel
savages.</p>

<p>When the Indian Chiefs arrived next day, they found
a small-sized army of over fifteen hundred fighting men
drawn up in battle array. The soldiers were silent,
their bright red coats of the Royal Americans shone
brightly against the green of the forest, the bayonets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>flashed; the flags fluttered; and the even ranks of backwoodsmen
in fringed hunting-frocks and moccasins had
stern determination written upon their weather-beaten
countenances. The Highlanders, with bare legs and
kilts, leaned carelessly upon their rifles and gazed with
indifference at the painted chieftains of the forest, who,
seating themselves with sullen dignity, appointed one of
their number to deliver a speech. In this the orator
promised to give up all the white captives which
the Indians held and to make peace. "I am come
among you to force you to make atonement for the injuries
you have done us," answered the martial Bouquet.
"I have brought with me the relatives of those you have
murdered. They are eager for vengeance, and nothing
restrains them from taking it but my assurance that this
army shall not leave your country until you have given
them ample satisfaction. You are all in our power, and,
if we choose, we can exterminate you from the earth,
but the English are a merciful and generous people,
adverse to shed the blood even of their greatest enemies;
and if it were possible that you could convince us that
you sincerely repent of your past perfidy, and that we
could depend on your good behavior for the future,
you might yet hope for mercy and peace. If I find that
you faithfully execute the conditions which I shall
prescribe, I will not treat you with the severity which
you deserve. I give you twelve days from this date
to deliver into my hands all the prisoners in your possession,
without exception&mdash;Englishmen, Frenchmen,
women, and children&mdash;whether adopted into your
tribes, married, or living among you under any denomination
or pretense whatsoever. And you are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
furnish these prisoners with clothing, provisions, and
horses, to carry them to Fort Pitt. When you have
fully complied with these conditions, you shall then
know on what terms you may obtain the peace you sue
for." This speech had the desired effect; prisoners by
the hundreds were soon brought in, and, after forcing
the Indians to give him hostages to insure the keeping
of peace, Bouquet went back to the settlements with his
army, threatening that if the Indians again went upon
the war path he would return with a larger force and
completely annihilate the warring tribes.</p>

<p>News of this was reported to Pontiac, as he sullenly
meditated further plans for revenge in his wigwam
among the Illinois. Daily he saw his followers dropping
off from him. To hold out longer against the whites
was folly. He was surrounded by enemies. In the
West were unfriendly Indian tribes; to the South were
the hereditary enemies of his people, the Cherokees;
in the East were the whites, and to the North a strong
and vigorous garrison held the fortress of Detroit.
Foiled, defeated, dismayed, he determined to accept
that peace which he knew that the English would give,
to smoke the calumet (or peace pipe) with his white
conquerors, and to wait for some favorable opportunity
for revenge. Consequently he attended a council
between his tribesmen&mdash;the Ottawas&mdash;and the English
at Detroit, promised allegiance to the British flag, and,
requesting that the past be forgotten, threw down a
wampum belt upon the floor, saying: "By this belt I
remove all evil thoughts from my heart. Let us live
together as brothers." In the spring he attended a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
council at Oswego, New York, presided over by Sir
William Johnson, and, being requested for a speech,
rose to say: "Father, when our great father of France
was in this country, I held him fast by the hand. Now
that he is gone, I take you, my English father, by the
hand, in the name of all nations, and promise to keep
this covenant as long as I live." Here he delivered a
belt of wampum. "Father, when you address me, it is
the same as if you addressed all the nations of the West.
Father, this belt is to cover and strengthen our chain
of friendship, and to show you that if any nation shall
lift the hatchet against our English brethren we shall be
the first to feel and resent it."</p>

<p>True to his promise, the Great War Chief remained
at peace with the whites from now on. Who can
reckon what bitter thoughts must have assailed this
red Napoleon when he considered the humiliating close
of his campaign? Proud, ambitious, savage, he saw
the oncoming rush of the men of a different race with
revengeful apprehension. His great plan of extermination
of the British had completely failed. The Indian
lack of order, well-defined plan, and knowledge of warfare,
had failed to make but a temporary impression
upon the garrison of the frontier. Their non-providence
of provisions and forethought in gathering them, had
caused the abandonment of the siege of Detroit. Their
inability to successfully approach a well-built stockade
had made it impossible for them to damage the walls of
Fort Pitt. Pontiac had plead with his white Canadian
allies&mdash;during the attack on Detroit&mdash;and had requested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>them to show his Indians how to make tunnels of approach
as the English did in their own warfare. But
the French said that they did not, themselves, know
how to dig these trenches&mdash;which was an untruth&mdash;and
so he had to give up this proper method of attack. Had
his followers been taught in the civilized schools of
military discipline, they would, by mere numbers, have
annihilated the brave defenders of Detroit; but they
were children of the forest&mdash;rude, untutored huntsmen&mdash;and
as such only could they make war.</p>

<p>Across from the present city of St. Louis, Missouri, is
an old hamlet called Cahokia, and here were gathered
several Illinois Indians one pleasant day of the early
spring of 1769. Pontiac had wandered to St. Louis to
see an old acquaintance called St. Ange, and, hearing
that some drinking bout, or social gathering was in progress,
told his white acquaintance that he was going to
cross the river to see what the warriors of Illinois were
doing. St. Ange besought him not to join them, for
he was not popular with this tribe. "I am a match for
the English; I am a match for twenty red men," answered
the Ottawa Chief, boastfully, "and I have no
fear for my life." So saying, he entered a canoe and
crossed to the other shore of the river.</p>

<p>A feast was in progress, and to it the mighty Pontiac
was invited as soon as his presence among the Illinois
was known. There were songs, boasts, speeches, and the
whiskey bottle was passed freely about. There is no
doubt that the red Emperor drank deeply, and, when
the affair was over, he walked majestically down the
village street to the adjacent woods, where he was
heard to chant his medicine songs in the dark and silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
wood. An English trader who had an intense dislike
for the mighty war chief was then in the village, and,
seeing that the moment was propitious for an assault
upon him, bribed a strolling warrior of the Kaskaskia
tribe of the Illinois with a barrel of liquor to kill the
fierce leader of the Ottawas. Fired, perhaps, by an
equal hatred for Pontiac, the red assassin soon consented
to do the deed, for he was promised still further reward
if he should be successful. As the dark figure of the
leader of the great Indian conspiracy loomed strangely
erect in the shadow of the forest, a silent form crept&mdash;like
a wildcat&mdash;close to where he stood. A twig snapped.
Pontiac turned to see what disturbed the quiet of the
forest, and, as he did so, a tomahawk was buried in his
brain. He fell prostrate upon the green carpet of moss.
A shrill wail of triumph startled the night birds from
the branches, and thus, foully and brutally assaulted,
died the mighty Sachem of the Ottawas.</p>

<h2>LOGAN: THE MIGHTY ORATOR AND WARRIOR OF THE MINGOES</h2>


<p>A frontiersman in the Ohio country, named
Brown, was looking about for good land upon
which to settle, and, finding some excellent territory
in the Kishacognillas Valley, was wandering
around in search of springs. About a mile from the
edge of the valley he discovered a bear, and as he travelled
along&mdash;hoping to get a shot at him&mdash;he suddenly came
upon a spring. Being very thirsty, he set his rifle
against a small tree, and, rushing down the bank near
the water, laid down to drink.</p>

<p>"Upon putting my head down," says the pioneer,
"I saw reflected in the water, on the opposite side, the
shadow of a tall Indian. I sprang to my rifle, when
the savage gave a yell, whether for peace or war I was
not just then sufficiently master of my faculties to
determine; but upon my seizing my rifle and facing
him, he knocked up the pan of his gun, threw out the
priming, and extended his open palm to me in token
of friendship. After putting down our guns, we again
met at the spring and shook hands. This was Logan&mdash;the
best specimen of humanity I ever met with, either
white or red. He could speak a little English, and told
me that there was another white hunter a little way
down the stream, and offered to guide me to his camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
There I met another white man named Maclay. We
remained together in the valley a week, looking for
springs and selecting lands, and laid the foundation
of a friendship which never had the slightest interruption.</p>

<p>"We visited the camp at Logan's Spring, and Maclay
and he shot at a mark for a dollar a shot. Logan lost
four of five rounds, and acknowledged himself beaten.
When we were about to leave him, he brought out as
many deerskins as he had lost dollars, and handed them
to Mr. Maclay, who refused to take them, alleging that
we had been his guests, and did not come to rob him;
that the shooting had only been a trial of skill, and the
bet merely nominal.</p>

<p>"Logan drew himself up with great dignity, and said:
'Me bet to make you shoot your best&mdash;me a gentleman,
and me take your dollar if me beat.'</p>

<p>"So he was obliged to take the skins, or affront our
friend, whose nice sense of honor would not permit him
to receive even a horn of powder in return."</p>

<p>This incident well illustrates the character of Logan:
a Chief of the Mingoes, one of the bravest of men, one
of the greatest of orators, and a redskin who preferred
peace to war. He was the second son of Shikellimus&mdash;a
wealthy Sachem&mdash;but, although he inherited the
talents of his father, he did not inherit his prosperity.
He took no part&mdash;except that of peace-making&mdash;in the
French and English war of 1760, and was always considered
a friend of the white man, as he was at heart, although
circumstances made him rebel against the
aggressions of the frontiersmen. His residence was at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
western settlement near Sandusky, Ohio, and near by
were about three hundred red warriors.</p>

<p>This eminent Indian supported his family by killing
deer, dressing the skins, and selling them to the whites.
He also traded in the land, which he had inherited from
his forebears, and sold quite a piece to a tailor named
De Yong, who lived in Ferguson's Valley, near the
Scioto River. According to the stipulation in this
particular trade, he received his pay in wheat, and,
taking it to the mill, found it so worthless that the miller
refused to grind it, saying: "It is good for nothing.
Take it away." Much chagrined at this turn of fortune,
the Indian Chief took the matter before a Judge, named
Brown, who questioned him about the character of the
wheat, asking him what was in it that so much resembled
the wheat itself, and yet was not wheat.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to call it," said Logan.</p>

<p>"It must have been <i>cheat</i>," said the Judge.</p>

<p>"Yah," answered the Indian, "that very good name
for him. It was cheat."</p>

<p>"I will give you redress," cried the man of law, handing
him a writ to give to the constable. "This will bring
you in money for your skins. Take it to the constable
and he will see that you have justice."</p>

<p>But the uncivilized, yet honest, Indian could not
understand how this little piece of paper could force a
rogue to pay him what he really owed. "I no understand,"
said he.</p>

<p>Judge Brown took down his own commission, with the
arms of the King upon it, and explained to the Mingo
Chief the first principles and operations of the civil law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Law good," said Logan, after a while. "Make
rogues pay up. White man's law good. But my law
better&mdash;Do to other man as you wish him to do to
you."</p>

<p>Another incident well exhibits the goodness of heart
possessed by this noted warrior, until cruel injustice
made him turn against the whites with hatred and revenge
in his soul.</p>

<p>When a child of a certain Mrs. Norris was just beginning
to learn to walk, her mother remarked&mdash;in the
presence of Logan&mdash;that she was sorry that she did not
have a pair of moccasins for her daughter, so that her
feet could be more firmly supported as she endeavored
to stand upright. The Indian said nothing, at the
time, but soon afterwards asked Mrs. Norris if she would
not allow the little girl to go with him to his cabin and
spend the day. To this request the mother gave a
reluctant consent, for she feared treachery, but knowing
the delicacy of an Indian's feelings&mdash;and particularly
those of Logan&mdash;she finally permitted her little girl to
accompany the celebrated red man to his home. The
hours of the day wore slowly away&mdash;only too slowly
for the anxious mother. It was soon dusk, and still her
little one had not returned. Mrs. Norris was in a
paroxysm of fear, but just as the sun began to sink in the
West, the trusty chieftain was seen coming down the
path before the house, holding the little girl in his arms,
and upon her feet were two beaded moccasins&mdash;the
product of Logan's skillful handiwork.</p>

<p>This well illustrates the kindly spirit of Logan. He
lived quietly and peacefully, until events occurred which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
changed the whole course of his life. In the spring of
1774, a robbery and murder occurred in the Ohio country,
among some of the white settlers, and the crime
was laid to the door of the Mingoes. It is probable that
the Indians did not commit the crime, for numerous
white adventurers were traversing the frontier at this
time, some of whom disguised themselves as Indians,
and thought no more of murder than of sleep. In spite
of this a cry went up from all sides, "Revenge upon the
red dogs who have stolen our horses and killed our
friends! Revenge!"</p>

<p>It was not long before other events occurred which
soon led to a serious war. Among the backwoodsmen
on the Maryland border was a settler named Michael
Cresap&mdash;a good, sturdy woodsman, but when his blood
was heated and his savage instincts were aroused, he
was a relentless hater, and a determined, vindictive
enemy. He feared no man and would as readily kill a
redskin as a deer. Collecting a party of armed huntsmen,
he paddled down the Kanawha River in quest of
vengeance upon the Indians, and soon perpetrated a
foul and ignoble deed. As he and his followers rounded
a bend in the stream near Yellow Creek, a canoe filled
with Indian women and children&mdash;and one man only&mdash;was
seen coming towards them. The savages were
unarmed, unprepared, and did not expect an attack
from the whites, who now concealed themselves on the
bank of the river and awaited the approach of the redskins.
The canoe soon touched the shore, a murderous
fire was opened upon the inoffensive occupants, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>before many moments, every Indian had been slaughtered.
Three of these people were relatives of Logan:
the man of peace and friend of the white man.</p>

<p>The great Mingo Chief had just been present at an
Indian council and had persuaded the Mingoes, who
feared war, that peace was far better. With a majestic
look he had declared that the "Long Knives," or Virginians,
would soon come like trees in the woods, and
would drive them from their lands, unless the hatchet
were laid down. His counsel had prevailed, the redskins
had decided to make no resistance to the whites,
but when they heard of the massacre their whole demeanor
was changed. Logan had been paid for his kindly
spirit of forbearance by the murder of his family. The
tiger was aroused in him. His proud spirit was fired
with intense anger, and, swearing that his tomahawk
should drink the blood of the white man till its vengeance
should be appeased with a tenfold expiation, he prepared
for a bloody struggle. On all sides the savages
made ready for a long and serious campaign.</p>

<p>Skirmishing had already taken place between bands of
Indians and whites, but no great battle was to occur for
some time. Logan&mdash;with a band of eight chosen warriors&mdash;boldly
penetrated the white settlements at the headwaters
of the Monongahela River, took many prisoners,
killed many whites, and defied every attempt at capture.
The Shawnees, the Mingoes (or Senecas) and a few Delawares
and Cherokees were also in the field, pillaging,
burning and murdering on the frontier; while the white
settlers crowded into the large towns for protection.</p>

<p>An incident now occurred which well exhibits the
kindly spirit of Logan, even when in the heat of battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
when blood was being freely spilled on every side, and
when the savages were taking every possible advantage
of the whites. A white prisoner named William Robinson
fell into the hands of Logan's band, and, being
tried by the council, the great Mingo Chief endeavored
for nearly an hour to persuade his men to let the captive
go. But his eloquence was of no avail, and it was decided
that the trembling paleface should be tortured at the
stake. While bound to a post, Logan suddenly leaped
into the circle of howling redskins, cut the thongs which
held the prisoner, threw a belt of wampum around him,
led him in safety to his wigwam, and shouted in a loud
voice to the clamoring braves, "I have adopted him in
place of my brother killed at Yellow Creek."</p>

<p>A few days later the Chief of the warring red men
dictated a letter to his adopted brother, who wrote it
upon birch bark with ink made of gun powder and
water. It was completed, tied to a war club, and stuck
into the logs of a house near Helston Creek, where the
entire family which had formerly resided there had been
massacred. Some days later it was found by a party of
riflemen, who were decidedly surprised and chagrined
to read the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Captain Cresap:&mdash;What did you kill my people on
Yellow Creek for? The white people killed my kin at
Conestoga, a great while ago, and I thought nothing
of that. But you killed my kin again on Yellow Creek,
and took my cousin prisoner. Then I thought I must
kill, too, and I have been three times to war since; but
the Indians are not angry&mdash;only myself.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Captain John Logan.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldiers who found this note were upon a foray
into the Ohio territory, led by a Colonel McDonald, who
was a brave and resolute Indian fighter. They were
much impressed by the dignity of this missive, but did
not stop upon their errand of death, and, pushing
to the mouth of Captina Creek, moved upon the Mingo
village of Wapitomica, on the Muskingum, destroying
several villages on the way, and returning safely with
several chiefs as prisoners. But they were pursued by
the savages in force, and realizing that to insure peace
upon the border, it would be necessary to send a good-sized
army against the allied tribes, the Governor of Virginia
(Lord Dunmore) decided to send a small army of
backwoodsmen, soldiers, and trappers into the country
of the redskins. Three thousand men were ordered to advance
against the Indians. One half of the force under
the command of General Andrew Lewis was to march to
the mouth of the Kanawha River in Ohio; while Governor
Dunmore, himself, was to lead the other half from
Pittsburg to Point Pleasant, Ohio, where the two bodies
were to meet and fight a decisive battle with the Indian
warriors under Logan and Cornstalk; the latter a great
Chief of the Shawnees, and an excellent fighter.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you that the Long Knives would
move against us?" said Logan to his followers. "They
must be defeated. I wished to live at peace with my
white brothers, and I bore them no ill will, until they
murdered my relatives. I fear that we shall not have
strength enough to beat off these palefaces, but have
courage, ye red men, and we shall have many a scalp of
these fringed shirts to hang in our wigwams."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will be ready," shouted his followers, and soon
their wild war cries echoed through the forests as they
leaped about in a circle and prepared their spirits for
the coming battles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sturdy pioneers were collecting on the
frontier and preparing for the advance into the wilderness.
General Andrew Lewis was a stout backwoodsman
who little feared the savages and had a contempt
for danger that was extraordinary. His army soon
gathered in the western mountains of Virginia, and a
hardier, more energetic body of fighters it would have
been difficult to find. With droves of pack-horses to
carry their light equipment, and numbers of beef cattle
to feed upon, the men in buckskin and fringed hunting
shirts finally moved off in the direction of Ohio and the
Great Kanawha. There were one hundred and sixty
miles of wilderness to pass through before the objective
point would be reached, and deep forests lay in the path
of the little army. But in the front was a veteran scout,
who knew the dense wilderness like a book, and piloted
the soldiers surely and directly to the river which they
searched for.</p>

<p>As the small force moved through the forest, the men
presented a most picturesque appearance. The straggling
sunbeams glistened upon their long rifles and
sheath knives, while their powder horns swung jauntily
from long cords across their bodies and tapped against
the wooden butts of their guns, as they were held carelessly
under the right shoulders. The twigs and branches
crashed as the pack train pushed its way through the
unbroken forest, the horses snorting and whinnying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the oxen and cows lowing and grunting, while the baaing
of a few sheep added to the general disturbance. The
men marched silently, without singing or laughing, for
they were on gruesome business, and they knew that
many of their numbers would not return. In the front
was Colonel Charles Lewis&mdash;a brother of the General
in charge. He was resplendent in a scarlet coat, and
this one bit of color was the only bright spot among the
yellow buckskin hunting shirts and the dark coonskin
caps of the Rangers. Surely, carefully, and courageously
they moved onward upon their mission of death, while
the startled deer sped from their path like the shadows
of those departed.</p>

<p>Upon the last day of September the army of invasion
reached its destination and speedily formed an intrenched
camp. Lewis waited for a week for the arrival
of Lord Dunmore and his men. "Egad," said he at
length, "I believe that the old fox has deserted us, and
we Virginians must fight the redskins on our own hook."</p>

<p>Hardly had he made the remark when a scout came
running into the camp with news that startled the
vigilant commander.</p>

<p>"While hunting deer with Tom Briscoe," said he,
"we suddenly came upon a camp of Cornstalk's men,
all of them in war paint. They fired upon us before we
could get away and killed my companion. Now I am
come to tell you that they are advancing upon you, and
you will be attacked before another sun."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" drawled General Lewis, lighting his
pipe. "Then we must get ready for the varmints and
fight them without Lord Dunmore and his men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after this he rose from the stump upon which
he was seated and gave orders that his brother Charles
Lewis should take two regiments and march in the direction
of the Indians to reconnoitre next morning,
while he made a proper disposition of the rest of the
army, in order to support them. The two regiments
had barely advanced a quarter of a mile from the camp,
when loud war whoops sounded from their front and
flanks, and they were suddenly set upon by a howling,
yelping mob of redskins. It was just about daylight,
and, dropping immediately behind stumps and fallen
logs, the soldiers awaited the attack of the Indians with
calm determination. Remembering past battles with
the children of the forest, the Rangers did not heedlessly
expose themselves, and fired only when they saw
the head or portion of the body of a warrior. The
firing grew hot. The yelling and screeching of the
savages was discordant and fierce, while the steady
"crack, crack" from their rifles soon began to tell upon
the crouching ranks of the Virginian volunteers. Colonel
Charles Lewis was most conspicuous in his red coat and
so became an easy target for the guns of the savages.
Soon, pierced by several balls, he was obliged to leave
the firing line, and, staggering back to the camp, he
perished with his face towards the foe, still urging on the
Rangers with his dying breath.</p>

<p>At this moment it seemed as if the redskins would
triumph. Above the din of battle Cornstalk's voice
could be heard, calling, "Be strong! Be strong!" And
when a savage showed symptoms of flight, he is said to
have immediately struck him down with his tomahawk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
A warrior named Red Hawk, too, was conspicuous
among his own men, urging them on to resistance with
stern voice and determined gestures. The right wing
of the Americans began to give way, the Rangers began
to fall back from the murderous bullets, but at this time
reinforcements rushed to the threatened point, and,
with a yell as fierce as that of the savages, the fresh
troops crept up to the oncoming foe. The two lines
were more than a mile in length, the combatants were
so close together that they often grappled in a hand-to-hand
combat, using their knives and tomahawks freely.
The crack of the rifles was mingled with the groans of the
wounded, the jeers of the Indians, the shouts of the
backwoodsmen, and the wild yells of the chiefs and commanding
officers.</p>

<p>It was now about twelve o'clock, and the savages began
to give way before the assaults of the entire army of
Virginians, who had just come up. But, instead of retreating
to a great distance, the Indians hid behind a
breastwork of fallen logs and branches which extended
clean across a neck of land which ran between the Ohio
and Kanawha Rivers. Not only had they had forethought
enough to prepare this, but they had placed
men on both sides of the stream, in the rear of the
Virginians, so that if they had been defeated not one
would have been able to escape. The warriors retreated
stubbornly, contesting each inch of the way, and soon&mdash;from
the protection of the stout breastwork&mdash;easily
held at bay the victorious white men. Colonel Fleming,
who commanded the left wing, was twice hit, but kept
his command and continually cheered on his men with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
words of confidence. When the reinforcements had
arrived at the critical moment, he was again shot&mdash;this
time through the lungs&mdash;but he still refused to give way
to any other officer, and led his men right up to the
breastwork, behind which fifteen hundred Shawanoe,
Delaware, Mingo, Wyandot, and Cayuga warriors poured
a rain of bullets at the oncoming Virginians. The
Rangers lay down behind the trees and boulders of the
forest and eagerly waited further orders.</p>

<p>General Lewis saw that he had to cripple the enemy or
they would be claiming a victory and would thus get aid
from other tribes. Seventy-five of his men had been
either killed or mortally wounded, and over one hundred
were slightly disabled. It was time for action, so, sending
three companies to the rear of the breastwork, he
ordered the backwoodsmen to dash into the Indians from
that direction, while the rest of the army would swarm
over the front of the fortification. Unseen by the
savages, the soldiers were soon in the forest behind the
supposedly impregnable position of the red warriors,
but scouts brought news of their advance to Cornstalk,
and, believing them to be reinforcements from
Lord Dunmore, and not part of the very troops which
he had been just engaged with, the Indian War Chief
ordered a retreat. As the sun sank upon the field of
battle, the Indian fighting men fell back across the river
in the direction of their towns along the Ohio River,
while cheer after cheer went up from the Virginians,
as they realized that the day of bloodshed had been
ended.</p>

<p>The battle was over, at last, and it had been a severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
struggle. Fifty-two graves had to be dug for the dead
backwoodsmen of the forest, while half the commissioned
officers were lifeless upon that bloody field. The
Indians' loss is unknown&mdash;thirty-three were found dead
on the ground which had been contended for, but, as
many of their stricken had been thrown into the river,
it was impossible to ascertain exactly how many had
fallen. The probabilities are that they lost about as
many as did the whites, and thus the battle of Point
Pleasant or the Great Kanawha, in the autumn of 1774,
seems to justify the assertion that it was the most severe
Indian battle that had taken place upon the soil of
America up to that time. The whites were eager for
another fight, as they wished to revenge the death of
their comrades, and so, as soon as burial services were
over for those who had fallen, they again took up the
march in the direction in which the Indians had disappeared.
There were many curses against Lord Dunmore
for not having joined them, as he had promised,
and several of the Virginian Rangers called him "coward"
and "traitor."</p>

<p>So near, indeed, had this British Governor been to
the Virginians at Point Pleasant, during the battle, that
his men could easily hear the sound of fighting when they
placed their ears to the ground. He had advanced
from Pittsburg with a strong force and could certainly
have fallen upon the rear of the Indians had he so wished,
but, as he did not hurry his course, it is evident that he
had no intention of co-operating with the troops of
General Lewis, as he had proposed to do. Some have
contended that he wished to sacrifice the Virginians so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
as to defeat the savages himself, and secure reputation
for great prowess. This is an absurd contention, for
he would speedily have been denounced as a treacherous
dog and would have suffered death from his own men.
Others have stated that he felt that the Indians' cause
was a just one, that he knew that the Virginians were
soon going to rebel against England, and thus he wished
to bring peace with as little destruction of life as possible.
It is probable that he was anxious to keep the good will
of the Indians, with a view of gaining them as allies to
the mother country later on. In fact, after the American
Revolution broke out, he sent emissaries to these
very savages, asking their assistance against the people
of Virginia, so his lack of aggression in advancing to
the aid of General Lewis is, therefore, partly explained.
We must remember that he was an Englishman, was
patriotic, and wished to do nothing that would hurt
the interests of the mother country.</p>

<p>The troops under Lord Dunmore, numbering as many
as those of General Lewis, passed through the Blue
Range at Potomac Gap, and crossed into Ohio near
Wheeling, West Virginia. As the British advanced
into the Indian country, scouts came in from the Senecas
and Delawares, and, on October sixth, Lord Dunmore
had a conference with them, offering terms of peace.
The savages carried his words back to the retreating
warriors who had fought at Point Pleasant, as Lord
Dunmore's army pushed on to the left bank of Sippo
Creek, Ohio. Here the soldiers soon made a fortified
camp, called Camp Charlotte, and waited for emissaries
from the warlike Indians. A messenger was also sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>intercept the march of General Lewis, telling him not to
fight again, until his commanding officer&mdash;Lord Dunmore&mdash;had
had a conference with the red men, but,
smarting from the loss of his brother, and fired with
the zeal for a signal victory, Lewis felt little desire to
heed the command of the Governor, and pressed on to
Congo Creek, which was within striking distance of the
Indian towns near Chillicothe, Ohio. Again Dunmore
sent him a command not to attack the Indians, and,
seeing that the Rangers were bent upon further bloodshed,
he went in person to find the Virginian leader.
Drawing his sword when he met him, he said: "Sir, if
you persist in your obstinacy in disobeying my commands,
I shall run you through with this weapon. I
am your commanding officer, sir." "I will retire,"
answered Lewis, "but your conduct, sir, is cowardly and
treacherous to the interests of Virginia."</p>

<p>The Indians were now thoroughly cowed by the show
of force which the whites presented and were, therefore,
contemplating peace. At a conference at their chief
town, Cornstalk arose and upbraided them because they
had not listened to his and Logan's suggestions for
peace before the bloody battle of Point Pleasant. "What
will you do now?" said he. "The Big Knife is coming on
us, and we shall all be killed. Now you must fight or we
are undone." He paused for a reply, and then added,
"Now let us kill all our women and children and go out
and fight the palefaces until we die?" Still there was
no answer to this brave proposal. So, rising from the
seat upon the ground, the Great Chief struck his tomahawk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>into a post of the council house with a sharp, resounding
blow, exclaiming, "I will then go and make
peace." "Ough! Ough!" came from all sides. "Go
and make peace." So the noted warrior hastened to
Dunmore's camp to settle the difficulties between them
immediately.</p>

<p>Logan was not with him; in fact, he had taken no part
in these councils, but had remained alone in the Mingo
village, brooding over the wrongs, and upon the cruel
vengeance which he had taken upon the whites for the
murder of his relatives. "He is like an angry dog,"
said a Delaware warrior. "His bristles are all up, but
they are gradually falling." When urged to attend the
peace conference, he muttered: "I am a warrior and not
a counsellor. I will not come to the meeting, for my
people have not followed my advice."</p>

<p>At the conference at Camp Charlotte Cornstalk spoke
for his red brethren, and he is said to have delivered a
great oration, which was quite equal to the speeches
of Patrick Henry, the great orator of the Virginia House
of Burgesses. "I have heard many orators," said
Colonel Wilson of Dunmore's staff, "but none whose
power of delivery surpassed that of Cornstalk on this
occasion. His looks when addressing Dunmore were
truly grand and majestic, yet peaceful and attractive.
When he arose, he was in no wise confused or daunted,
but spoke in a distinct and audible voice, without
stammering or repetition, and with peculiar emphasis."
Such was the impression which he created that a speedy
peace was agreed upon, which was to insure some years
of quiet to the frontiers of Virginia and Pennsylvania.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>The Indians retired to their towns, and the army of invasion
made preparations for returning to the settlements
of tide-water Virginia.</p>

<p>Although Logan had refused to attend the conference,
Lord Dunmore considered it most important to learn
what were his future intentions towards the whites, as
he was a renowned chieftain and had quite a following.
He could, in fact, easily stir up another rebellion, should
he so wish, and thus it would be of considerable value
to the whites to obtain from him a statement to the
effect that he would keep the peace in future. Therefore,
a messenger named John Gibson was sent to the
Mingo camp in order to interview the savage warrior
and persuade him to sign the peace pact. Gibson was
a frontier veteran who had lived for a long time near
the Indians and knew their manners, customs, and language
as well as that of his own race. And he proved
to be an excellent emissary, for Logan talked freely to
the sturdy backwoodsman. For some time they discussed
the war and its outcome, and then, weeping
bitterly, the Mingo Chieftain made a speech which will
always live as one of the finest examples of Indian
eloquence recorded in the history of the conquest of
America by the whites. Gibson took the words of
Logan down in writing, bade the sad old warrior farewell,
and, turning towards the English camp, soon had
presented the answer of the noble red man to Lord
Dunmore. The Governor read it in council before the
entire frontier army, among whom were Clark and
Cresap, the two backwoods soldiers to whom Logan
ascribed the murder of his family.</p>

<p>"I appeal to the white man to say if he ever entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Logan's cabin hungry and he gave him no meat; if ever
he came cold and naked and he clothed him not?" were
the words of Logan. "During the course of the last
long and bloody war (the French and Indian War, and
the Conspiracy of Pontiac) Logan remained idle in his
camp, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for
the whites that my countrymen pointed as I passed,
and said: 'Logan is the friend of the white man.'
I had even thought to have lived with you, but for the
injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring,
in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered all the relations
of Logan, not even sparing my women and children.
There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any
living creature. This called on me for revenge. I
have sought it. I have killed many. I have fully
glutted my vengeance. For my country I rejoice at
the beams of peace; but do not harbor a thought that
mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will
not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to
mourn for Logan? Not one."</p>

<p>To the sad and sober thoughts of the Mingo Chief,
the frontiersmen listened with respectful attention, and
in the hearts of some, no doubt, came feelings of remorse
that the lives of his own people had been so cruelly
taken. At the conclusion of the reading of this address,
Clark turned to Cresap and said: "You must be
a very great man that the Indians hold you guilty for
every mean thing that has happened." "It was not I
who did this deed, but Daniel Greathouse," answered
Cresap, "and I have half a mind to put an end to him
when next we meet, because of this brutal murder."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
It would have indeed been well if someone would have
made the guilty frontiersman suffer for this cruel deed,
which had wrecked the life and hopes of an Indian
Chief, who, at heart, was a friend of the pioneers, and
not an enemy. The triumph of the Anglo-Saxons had
dealt a heavy blow to the one red man of friendly intentions
who resided in the country of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The troops under Lord Dunmore soon returned to
Virginia, and, at the outbreak of the American Revolution,
took part in many of the engagements of the first
year of warfare. Proud, gloomy Logan never recovered
from the grief which the loss of his family had inspired.
His life was spent among his own people, and frequently
he was engaged in the various skirmishes and uprisings
of the border. We know that he became intemperate,
and, like so many other red men of noble qualities, became
a victim of drink&mdash;a habit which lowered him in
the estimation of both the whites and those of his own
race. At last, when returning from Detroit to his
own country, after assisting in making a treaty of peace,
he was murdered by a party of whites, but the details
of his death are not known.</p>

<p>Thus perished one of the few redskins who, at heart,
was friendly to those of a different color. One can
forgive his fierce outburst of passion against the whites,
for who of us would not have been constrained to do
likewise, after the murder of our entire family, and in
cold blood? His features were noble, his form was
majestic, his words bore evidence of a mind in which
only the loftiest thoughts resided. His speech to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>emissary of Lord Dunmore has been favorably compared
with the best efforts of Demosthenes and Cicero,
the great orators of Greece and Rome, and the annals
of Indian warfare have never brought to light a character
of similar grandeur and majesty of disposition. The
muse of history smiles brightly upon the spirit of Logan:
the Friend of the White Man, the Great Chieftain of
the Mingoes.</p>

<h2>RED JACKET, OR SA-GO-YE-WAT-HA: THE GREAT ORATOR OF THE SENECAS</h2>


<p>A little schooner was about to be launched in
a port of the eastern seaboard of the United
States, and crowds of people gathered around
to see the vessel take to the water. It was an event
of more than usual interest, for a tall Indian chief of
majestic bearing stood at the prow in order to speak a
word of parting to the new-made hull. He placed one
hand upon the planking, and, turning to the expectant
onlookers, spoke with great feeling.</p>

<p>"You have a great name given to you," he said, pointing
to the ship. "Your name is Red Jacket. Strive
to deserve this name. Be brave and daring. Go
boldly into the troublesome waters of the great sea
and fear neither the swift wind nor the strong waves.
Be not frightened nor overcome by them, for it is in
resisting storms and tempests that I, whose name you
bear, obtained my renown. Let my great example inspire
you to courage and lead you to glory. Strike,
you men! Break the underpinning from this favored
vessel and let us see it plough into the surging ocean!"
As he ceased, the stanchions which held the schooner
were knocked away, and proudly and serenely she dipped
into the waters of the blue Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>The great chief who had christened this little vessel
was one of the most famous orators who has ever existed
among the Indians of America. His birth is supposed
to have taken place about the year 1750, under
a great tree which formerly stood near the spring of
crystal water at Canoga Point, on the western shores
of Lake Cayuga, in western New York. His parents
were Senecas&mdash;a powerful tribe that lived at Can-e-de-sa-ga,
at the present site of Geneva, New York, and
they were members of the Iroquois confederation of
Indian people. His father, although a member of this
tribe, was by birth a Cayuga&mdash;a thoughtful and far-seeing
race, who were the scholars and thinkers of the
northern Indians&mdash;and, although learned, was not a
man of any prominence or distinction. His mother
is said to have had white blood in her veins, and so
the remarkable ability to express himself in a logical
manner may be traced to this taint in the blood of the
eloquent Red Jacket, who in infancy was called O-te-tiana,
which signifies, "The Always Ready."</p>

<p>Tradition has it that when a young man Red Jacket
was remarkably fleet of foot, so fleet, in fact, that he was
employed by his people as a "runner" or messenger.
But his ambition was to become a great orator and
speaker, and thus leaving the active participation in
warfare to spirits more bold than his own, he endeavored
to become the greatest counsellor among his people.
This ability to sway the thoughts and feelings of others
made him chief&mdash;a position to which he aspired, and of
which he was very jealous&mdash;and, when he came to
this honor, he took another name, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
custom of his nation. This was the euphonious one of
Sa-go-ye-wat-ha, which means "The Keeper Awake."</p>

<p>But how came it that he was called Red Jacket, when
these other names were so much more distinguished
and musical? This is explained by a chronicler of
this period of history, who says: "During the war of
the Revolution this Seneca warrior made himself very
useful to the British officers as a messenger. He was
doubtless of great value to them because of his intelligence
and gift for oratory, and, in return for his services,
the officers presented the young man with a scarlet
jacket, very richly embroidered. He took much delight
in this coat of a flaming red, and this peculiar
dress became a mark of distinction and gave him the
name by which he was afterwards best known. Even
after the war, when the Americans wished to particularly
ingratiate themselves with him, they would present
him with a red jacket. The young Prince of the
wolf den would don the bright raiment with a look of
immense pride, and he was much admired by his followers
as he strutted about attired in this attractive dress."
Thus Sa-go-ye-wat-ha became known by the title of
Red Jacket, a name which clung to him through life,
and by which he has been known to historians.</p>

<p class="center">RED JACKET, OR SA-GO-YE-WAT-HA.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The predecessor of Red Jacket, as Chief of the Senecas,
was a celebrated brave, called Corn Planter by the
English, a man well known for his oratorical powers
and skill as a warrior. This eminent Chieftain suddenly
found that his power over his men was declining, partly
owing to the fact that in 1784 he had used his influence
in consenting to a cession of Seneca land to the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>government at the treaty of Fort Stanwix, and partly
owing to the fact that he was growing so old that the
young blood of the tribe felt that a young man should
lead them. Bitterly chagrined by his loss of popularity,
Corn Planter resolved upon a desperate exertion to restore
his departing influence, and, with this end in view,
determined to practice upon the superstitions of the
Indians and rid himself of those chiefs who opposed
his rule. So he had his brother declare himself a
prophet or Messiah, and, stating that he had come
to restore the former prestige of the red men and make
them again great, he soon had great influence among
the credulous Senecas.</p>

<p>But now the evil designs of Corn Planter came to a
head. The Prophet declared that several members of
the tribe were wizards or magicians, and among them
Red Jacket was named as the chief offender. He was
publicly denounced by those influenced by the Prophet,
who, at a great Indian council, declared that he should
be put to death. At this crisis Red Jacket knew that
his safety and life itself depended upon his intellectual
powers, and so determined to make use of the greatest
oratorical efforts that he was capable of. Appearing
before the assembled Indians, he rose majestically before
them, and throwing back his blanket said in part:</p>

<p>"Brothers, you accuse me of being a Wizard and
Sorcerer. This Prophet, the brother of Corn Planter,
has told you that I am a man of evil thoughts and would
work you ill. It is an untruth. Never since I was
a small boy have I thought evil of any of my own race,
and never since I came of age have I ever labored for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
anything but the good of my people. How can I, who
have loved you at a peace all these years, have married
among you, have brought up my children among you,
how can I, I say, wish ill to the people whom I have
starved, slept and feasted with? Brothers, you know
that in the treaty at Fort Stanwix I was for war, while
Corn Planter was for peace and wished to give over our
lands to the whites. You see how you have fared by
following his advice. You are now poor, without hunting
ground, and the white men have your best lands.
Had you stood by me, and had you waged war upon
the whites, we would have defeated them, driven them
from our borders, and we would now have good grounds
to live upon. You see how following this man's advice
has served us."</p>

<p>This he continued for three hours, at the end of which
time he had fully persuaded the Indians that the Prophet
was an imposter and fraud, that Corn Planter should be
deposed, and that he himself should be freed from
all charges against himself. The savages had all been
in favor of his death, but, swayed by this masterful
eloquence, a portion of their numbers came to his way
of thinking, and when a vote was taken in regard to
what disposition should be made of him, their numbers
were sufficient to set him free. Corn Planter's influence
was at an end, and soon Red Jacket was foremost in
the councils of those of his own nationality. The
masterful power of oratory had won him the foremost
position in his own tribe.</p>

<p>The Indians, in fact, had fared ill for the part that
they had taken in the American Revolution, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the American Colonists of New York and the British.
Influenced by the Iroquois and their powerful ally,
Captain Joseph Brant&mdash;the great war chief of the Mohawks&mdash;they
had thrown in their lot with the English
troops. Red Jacket had eloquently plead with his
people to remain neutral. "Let these whites fight it
out among themselves," he had said, "while we remain
upon our own lands and take care of ourselves. What
have the English done for us? What will they do for
us if they win, but insist upon a division of our land?"
He here rose to his fullest height, (for he was in the
council chamber) and pointed to the winding current
of the Mohawk. "Why should we leave our beautiful
country by the shimmering waters of the river which
we love, in order to become killed, maimed and homeless
for the sake of our white brothers? Why should we
give up everything for these men, I say, when we are
happy and peaceful here? It is none of our quarrel.
Let us rest."</p>

<p>In spite of this appeal his own warriors would not
listen to his words of advice and called him a coward,
and also the "cow-killer." With smirks and grimaces
they would often tell how at the outbreak of the war
the young chief had exhorted all about him to be filled
with valor and courage, to march forth valiantly towards
the enemy, for he, himself, would be there in the
thickest of the fighting. Stirred by his address, the
warriors were soon engaged in battle, but when they
looked for the orator he was missing. In vain they
searched for him at the close of hostilities, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>at last, found him cutting up a cow which he had captured
near the Indian village. This story was spread
broadcast, it caused great amusement, and many a
Seneca was heard to say: "Sa-go-ye-wat-ha, he talk
much, but he no back up his big words."</p>

<p>At the close of the Revolutionary War, however,
these warriors who had previously reviled the sage
counsellor of the Senecas wished that they had listened
more favorably to his advice. The British army of
invasion under Burgoyne which the Senecas and Mohawks
allied themselves with, was badly whipped at
Saratoga, and those who were not captured fled to
Canada. The country came into the possession of the
American troops; the Mohawks emigrated to Canadian
soil, where they were given no aid by the English, and
the Senecas were treated in a high-handed manner by
the victorious sons of New England. Many of the
members of this powerful tribe perished in the battles
around Saratoga, and, as they were fighting for a cause
which they did not understand, it soon became apparent
to them that they should have followed the advice of the
great orator. Too late they realized that the old adage
was true, which runs, "A prudent man foreseeth the evil
and hideth himself, but the simple pass on and are
punished."</p>

<p>From the close of the American Revolution to the
outbreak of the war of 1812, the Senecas lived in peace
and seclusion upon their lands. President George
Washington extended to them the hand of friendship
and offered them protection from their enemies if they
would sign a treaty with him. This they did, and the
great American leader filled a place in their affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
which has never been equalled by any white man, save
Roger Williams or William Penn. So strong was the
influence of the "Father of his Country" among them,
that in subsequent disturbances in their dominions the
Senecas either remained neutral or else were loyal to
the Americans and their interests. Red Jacket himself
was one of fifty chiefs who journeyed to Philadelphia to
visit Washington in 1792, where he was presented with
a silver medal on which the President, in military
uniform, was represented as handing a long peace pipe
to an Indian chief with a scalp-lock decorated with
plumes on the top of his head, while a white man was
ploughing with a yoke of oxen in the background&mdash;a
hint to the Indians to abandon war and adopt the peaceful
pursuits of agriculture. Red Jacket accepted this
with much pleasure, prized it very highly, and wore it
on all occasions of state.</p>

<p>When war broke out between the Americans and
British in 1812, the Senecas immediately offered their
services to their American neighbors. But their proffer
of aid was rejected, and every effort was made to induce
them to remain neutral. The Indians did not care for
such treatment, but said nothing. At last, in the summer
of 1812, the English troops took possession of Grand
Island, in the Niagara River, and this was a valuable
possession of the Senecas. Immediately, therefore,
they were anxious for war, a council was called, the
American Indian Agent was summoned to attend, and
Red Jacket arose to address him.</p>

<p>"Brother," he said, "you have told us that we had
nothing to do with the war between you and the British.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
But the war has come to our doors. Our property is
seized by the British and their Indian friends. It is
necessary for us then to go to war. We must defend
our property. We must drive the enemy from our soil.
If we sit still on our lands and take no means of redress,
the British, following the custom of you white people,
will hold them by conquest, and you, if you conquer
Canada, will claim them on the same principles, as conquered
from the British. Brother, we wish to go with
our warriors and drive off these bad people and take
possession of those lands."</p>

<p>Such was the effect of this outburst of oratory upon
his hearers that a grand council of the Six Nations soon
came together and issued a manifesto against the British
in Canada. "We, the chiefs and counsellors of the
Six Nations of Indians, residing in the State of New
York, do hereby proclaim to all the war chiefs and
warriors of the Six Nations, that war is declared on our
part against the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada,"
ran this call to arms.</p>

<p>"Therefore, we do hereby command and advise all
the war chiefs to call forth immediately all the warriors
under them and put them in motion to protect their
rights and liberties, which our brethren, the Americans,
are now defending."</p>

<p>Soon about three thousand warriors were in the
field, eager and willing to assist the American troops
under General Boyd, who advanced into the State of
New York to battle with the British. On August
13th a fierce fight took place at Fort George, in which
the British were badly routed and a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
British Indians were captured by the Senecas under
Red Jacket.</p>

<p>"The bravery and humanity of the Indians were
equally conspicuous," says General Boyd in his dispatch.
"They behaved with great gallantry."</p>

<p>After the battle the Senecas neither scalped nor
murdered the dead, which was most extraordinary for
Indians. But at a council held the day before the
battle, they had agreed not to follow their usual custom&mdash;a
method of procedure which Red Jacket strongly advocated.
He, himself, fought courageously with his
followers; was seen to lead a charge more than once; and
certainly did away with any notions which his braves
might have entertained regarding his lack of courage in
battle. "Cow-killer" he was named no longer, and,
after the conclusion of peace between the English and
Americans, he began with accustomed energy to again
direct the civil interests of the Senecas.</p>

<p>Numerous white missionaries now came to the country
of the Indians, endeavoring as well as they could to
establish Christianity among the savages. One of
these&mdash;a missionary named Cram&mdash;made a long speech
to the Senecas, telling them that there was but one religion,
and unless they adopted it they could not prosper; that
they had lived all their lives in darkness; and that his
object in talking to them was not to get away their
lands, or money, but to turn them towards the true
Gospel. Finally, he asked them to state their objections,
if they had any, to the adoption of his religion.</p>

<p>He closed his address with a strong appeal to their
reasoning powers, and, after he had finished speaking, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Seneca Chiefs retired for a conference. After several
hours of talking, Red Jacket came from the tent in which
they had been seated, and striding forward, delivered
the following speech, which stands as one of the greatest
examples of Indian eloquence that is known to
history.</p>

<p>"Friend and Brother!" he began. "It was the will
of the Great Spirit that we should meet together this day.
He orders all things, and he has given us a fine day for
our council. He has taken his garment from before
the sun and has caused the bright orb to shine with
brightness upon us. Our eyes are opened so that we
see clearly. Our ears are unstopped so that we have
been able to distinctly hear the words which you have
spoken. For all these favors we thank the Great Spirit
and him only.</p>

<p>"Brother! This council fire was kindled by you. It
was at your request that we came together at this time.
We have listened with attention to what you have said.
You have requested us to speak our minds freely. This
gives us great joy, for we now consider that we stand
upright before you, and can speak what we think.
All have heard your voice and all speak to you as one
man. Our minds are agreed.</p>

<p>"Brother! You say that you want an answer to your
talk before you leave this place. It is right that you
should have one, as you are a great distance from home,
and we do not wish to detain you. But we will first
look back a little, and tell you what our fathers
have told us, and what we have heard from the white
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brother! Listen to what we say. There was a
time when our forefathers owned this great island
(meaning the continent of North America&mdash;a common
belief among the Indians). Their seats extended from
the rising to the setting of the sun. The Great Spirit
had made it for the use of Indians. He had created
the buffalo, the deer, and other animals for food. He
made the bear and the deer, and their skins served us
for clothing. He had scattered them over the country,
and had taught us how to take them. He had caused
the earth to produce corn for bread. All this he had
done for his red children because he loved them. If
we had any disputes about hunting grounds, they were
generally settled without the shedding of much blood.
But an evil day came upon us. Your forefathers
crossed the great waters and landed on this island. Their
numbers were small. They found friends and not
enemies. They told us they had fled from their own
country for fear of wicked men, and had come here to
enjoy their religion. They asked for a small seat. We
took pity on them, granted their request and they sat
down amongst us. We gave them corn and meat.
They gave us poison (spirituous liquor) in return. The
white people had now found our country. Tidings were
carried back and more came amongst us. Yet we did
not fear them. We took them to be friends. They
called us brothers. We believed them and gave them
a large seat. At length their numbers had greatly
increased. They wanted more land. They wanted our
country. Our eyes were opened, and our minds became
uneasy. Wars took place. Indians were hired to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
against Indians, and many of our people were destroyed.
They also brought strong liquors among us. It was
strong and powerful and has slain thousands.</p>

<p>"Brother! Our seats were once large, and yours were
very small. You have now become a great people, and
we have scarcely a place left to spread our blankets.
You have got our country, but you are not satisfied.
You want to force your religion upon us.</p>

<p>"Brother! Continue to listen. You say that you
are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit
agreeably to his mind; and if we do not take hold of the
religion which you white people teach we shall be unhappy
hereafter. You say that you are right, and we
are lost. How do we know this to be true? We understand
that your religion is written in a book. If it was
intended for us as well as for you, why has not the Great
Spirit given it to us; and not only to us, but why did
he not give to our forefathers the knowledge of that
book, with the means of understanding it rightly? We
only know what you tell us about it. How shall we
know when to believe, being so often deceived by the
white people?</p>

<p>"Brother! You say there is but one way to worship
and serve the Great Spirit. If there is but one religion,
why do you white people differ so much about it? Why
not all agree, as you can all read the book?</p>

<p>"Brother! We do not understand these things.
We are told that your religion was given to your forefathers
and has been handed down, father to son. We
also have a religion which was given to our forefathers,
and has been handed down to us, their children. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
worship that way. It teaches us to be thankful for all
the favors we receive, to love each other, and to be
united. We never quarrel about religion.</p>

<p>"Brother! The Great Spirit has made us all. But
he has made a great difference between his white and
red children. He has given us a different complexion
and different customs. To you he has given the arts;
to these he has not opened our eyes. We know these
things to be true. Since he has made so great a difference
between us in other things, why may not we conclude
that he has given us a different religion, according
to our understanding? The Great Spirit does right.
He knows what is best for his children. We are satisfied.</p>

<p>"Brother! We do not wish to destroy your religion,
or to take it from you. We only want to enjoy our
own.</p>

<p>"Brother! You say you have not come to get our
land or our money, but to enlighten our minds. I will
now tell you that I have been at your meetings and saw
you collecting money from the meeting. I cannot tell
what this money was intended for, but suppose it was
for your minister; and if we should conform to your
way of thinking, perhaps you may want some from us.</p>

<p>"Brother! We are told that you have been preaching
to white people in this place. These people are our
neighbors. We are acquainted with them. We will
wait a little while, and see what effect your preaching
has upon them. If we find it does them good and makes
them honest and less disposed to cheat Indians, we will
then consider again what you have said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brother! You have now heard our answer to
your talk, and this is all we have to say at present. As
we are going to part, we will come and take you by
the hand, and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on
your journey, and return you safe to your friends."</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Red Jacket appreciated
his own prowess to the full and realized what a wonderful
control he had over his followers. In the council
chamber he was supreme and usually was able to sway
the feelings of his hearers in whatever direction he
wished. Some one inquired one day what deeds of
blood he had done in order to make himself a true
warrior among the Senecas, and to this he replied: "A
warrior! I am an orator! I was born an orator."</p>

<p>A young French nobleman visited Buffalo about
1815, and hearing of the wonderful speaker, sent word
to Red Jacket that he wished to talk with him. But
the oratorical chief received this message with contempt.
"Tell the young man that if he wishes to visit
the old chief he will find him with his nation," said he,
"where other strangers pay their respect to him, and
Red Jacket will be glad to see him." To this the
Frenchman sent back word that he had taken a long
journey and was fatigued, that he had come all the way
from France to see the great orator of the Seneca nation
and hoped he would not refuse to meet him at Buffalo.
To this the Seneca brave sent the following answer:
"Tell him that having come so far to see me it is strange
he should stop within seven miles of my lodge." "By
Gad," said the nobleman, when this message was delivered
to him, "such a man of spirit must indeed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
worth journeying to see," and, without more ado, he
hastened to the lodge of the sarcastic Red Jacket.
The Seneca orator now consented to dine with him at
Buffalo, and, after the repast, the enthusiastic Frenchman
exclaimed: "He is a remarkable man. Had he
been white, he would have one of the greatest reputations
of the ages. He is a wonder greater than Niagara
Falls, which I have just visited."</p>

<p>Shortly after this an Indian was executed for the
murder of his wife, and a great crowd journeyed to see
the hanging. Red Jacket, however, was met going in
the opposite direction from the scene. "Why do you
not go to see this affair?" asked a friend. "Fools
enough are there already," replied the great orator.
"Battle is the proper place to see men die."</p>

<p>"When I dined with President Washington," said he
to a gentleman, "a man ran off with my knife and
fork every now and again, and returned with others.
What was that for?"</p>

<p>"There are a great many dishes," replied the gentleman,
"each cooked in a different manner. Every
time a new dish is brought on the table, the knives
and forks are changed."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Red Jacket, thoughtfully, "is that it?
You must then suppose that the plates and knives and
forks retain the taste of the cookery?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the white man.</p>

<p>"Have you then any method by which you can
change your palates every time you change your plates?
For I think the taste would remain on the palate longer
than it would on the plate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are in the habit of washing the taste on our
palates away with wine," answered the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Ah, I understand!" ejaculated Red Jacket. "I
was persuaded that so general a custom among you
must be founded on reason, and I only regret that when
I was in Philadelphia I did not understand it. The
moment the man went off with my plate, I would have
drunk wine until he brought me another; for although I
am fond of eating, I am more so of drinking."</p>

<p>This famous orator was not only fully conscious of his
own ability to sway the emotions of others, but he had
his full share of vanity. His forehead was lofty and
capacious; his eye was black and piercing; his nose was
sharply aquiline; while his cheek was well rounded.
Every feature marked a man of noble qualities, while an
air of dignified self-possession made a deep impression
upon all with whom he came in contact. When speaking,
his eyes flashed fire, his body was continually moving
in the effort of speech-making, while the ready words
poured from his lips in a steady stream. The cadence
of his speech was measured and very musical, and when
excited he would spring to his feet, elevate his head,
expand his arms and utter, with indescribable effort
of manner and tone, some great and noble thoughts.
A gentleman of the period has written: "It has been
my good fortune to hear the masterful Red Jacket but
a few times in late years when his powers were much
enfeebled by old age and intemperance, but I shall never
forget the impression made upon me the first time that
I saw him in council. The English language has no
figures to convey the true meaning of his speech, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
though coming through the medium of an illiterate
interpreter, I could well realize that he was giving me
a great oration."</p>

<p>The great Seneca was twice married, and, although
he had a large family, many of his children died of consumption.
A lady who took an interest in the Seneca
Nation once asked him whether he had any children
living. "Red Jacket was once a great man, and was in
favor with the Great Spirit," sorrowfully answered the
Chief. "He was a lofty pine among the smaller trees
of the forest, but after years of glory he degraded himself
by drinking the fire water of the white man. The
Great Spirit has, therefore, looked upon him in anger,
and his lightning has stripped the pine of its branches
and left standing only the scarred trunk, dead at the
top."</p>

<p>What the noted Seneca said of his degradation was
unfortunately too true, so true, in fact, that he was
deposed by the members of his tribe because of this
intemperance. Several rival chiefs were jealous of
his position, which partly explained this action of the
Senecas, although his opposition to the introduction of
the Christian religion into the tribe was also a reason
for removing him from the position of Head Chief.</p>

<p>Red Jacket&mdash;with the true spirit of a warrior&mdash;was
scarcely prepared to submit to such a degradation,
particularly as he knew that the true motives of the
chiefs who had deposed him were those of jealousy.
He felt the sting of shame, and remarked to one of his
tribe, with much feeling: "It shall not be said that
Sa-go-ye-wat-ha lived in insignificance and died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
dishonor. Am I too feeble to revenge myself upon my
enemies? Am I not as I have been? I will call in the
other tribes of the Six Nations, and we will see whether
or no Red Jacket will be deposed." Consequently, only
a month after his deposition, a Grand Council of the
chiefs of the Six Nations assembled together at the upper
council house of the Seneca village reservation.</p>

<p>After all had seated themselves, the document deposing
Red Jacket was read aloud, and then a Chief called
Half Town arose, and in behalf of the Catteraugus
Indians (a tribe of the Six Nations) said that there was
but one opinion in his nation, and that was of general
indignation at the ousting of Red Jacket from his position
as Chief Sachem. Several other chiefs addressed
the council to the same effect, and, at the close of their
speeches, the condemned orator arose very slowly, as
if grieved and humiliated, but still possessing his ancient
air of command.</p>

<p>After a solemn pause he began to speak. "My
brothers," said he, "you have this day been correctly
informed of an attempt to make me sit down and throw
off the authority of a chief, by twenty-six misguided
chiefs of my nation. You have heard the statements
of my associates in council and their explanations of
the foolish charges brought against me. I have taken
the legal and proper way to meet these charges. It is
the only way in which I could notice them: charges
which I despise and which nothing would induce me to
notice, but the concern which many respected chiefs of
my nation feel in the character of their aged comrade.
Were it otherwise, I should not be before you. I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
fold my arms and sit quietly under their ridiculous
slander.</p>

<p>"The Christian party has not even proceeded legally,
according to our usages, to put me down. Ah! It
grieves my heart when I look around me and see the
situation of my people, in old times united and powerful,
now divided and feeble. I feel sorry for my nation.
When I am gone to the other world&mdash;when the Great
Spirit calls me away&mdash;who among my people can take
my place? Many years have I guided my nation."</p>

<p>He now spoke of the attacks upon him and said that
they were incited by jealousy. He alluded to the
course taken by those of his own tribe who had turned
Christians as being ruinous and disgraceful, especially
in the abandonment of the religion of their fathers, and
their sacrifice to the whites for a few trinkets of the land
left them by their forefathers. "I will not consent
silently to be trampled under foot," he concluded.
"As long as I can raise my voice I will oppose such
measures. As long as I can stand in my moccasins, I
will do all that I can for my nation."</p>

<p>Such was the power of the old chief's oration, that, at
the close of this speech, he was almost unanimously reelected
to the position of Chief Sachem, a position which
he had held for many years, and which he was now
to hold until his death.</p>

<p>Shortly after this affair the great orator's second
wife joined the Christian Church, to which he, himself,
was opposed. Consequently Red Jacket immediately
left her and went to live in another Seneca reservation.
But he was far from happy when separated from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
whom he loved, and those whom he left behind were far
from happy without him. The old chief was devoted
to his little daughter, and he missed her caresses and
love. At length, he could stand the separation no
longer, and, through the agency of this little girl, a
reconciliation was effected with his excellent squaw.
Red Jacket promised that he would not again interfere
with his wife's religious privileges, and to his credit be
it said he never again objected to her religion or belief.</p>

<p>There he was living quietly and happily when suddenly
taken ill in the council house, where he had gone
one day, dressed with more than usual care and ornamented
with all his best finery. When he returned to
his tepee, he said to his wife. "I am ill. I could not
stay until the council had finished. I shall never recover."
So saying, he took off his rich dress, laid it
carefully away, lay down upon his couch and did not
rise again until morning. His wife then prepared some
medicine for him, which he patiently took, saying: "It
will do me no good. I shall die."</p>

<p>He then requested his faithful squaw to send his little
girl to him, and when she had come near he bade her sit
beside him and listen to his parting words. "My good
wife," said he, "I am going to die. Never again shall
I leave my home alive. I wish to thank you for your
kindness to me. <i>You have loved me.</i> You have always
prepared my food and taken care of my clothes, and been
patient with me. I am sorry that I ever treated you
unkindly. I am sorry that I left you because of your
new religion, and I am convinced that it is a good religion
and has made you a better woman, and I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
you to persevere in it. I should like to have lived
a little longer for your sake. I meant to build you a
new house and make you more comfortable, but it is
now too late. But I hope my daughter will remember
what I have often told her, not to go in the streets with
strangers or improper persons. She must stay at home
with her mother.</p>

<p>"When I am dead, it will be noised abroad through
all the world; they will hear of it across the great waters,
and will say: 'Red Jacket, the great orator, is dead.'
And white men will come and ask you for my body.
They will wish to bury me. But do not let them take
me. Clothe me in my simplest dress, put on my leggins
and my moccasins, and hang the cross which I have
worn so long around my neck, and let it lie upon my
bosom. Then bury me among my people. Neither
do I wish to be buried with Pagan rites. I wish the
ceremonies to be as you like, according to the customs
of your new religion, if you choose. Your minister says
that the dead will rise. Perhaps they will. If they
do, I wish to rise with my old comrades. I do not wish
to rise among palefaces. I wish to be surrounded by
red men. Do not make a feast according to the custom
of the Indians. Whenever my friends chose they could
come and feast with me when I was well, and I do not
wish those who have eaten with me in my cabin to
surfeit at my funeral feast."</p>

<p>When the great Chief had finished, he laid himself
upon his couch, took his little daughter fondly by the
hand, and did not rise again. A few days later death
overtook him, and at his funeral many parties of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
own tribe were present. His body was removed from
his cabin into the mission house, where religious services
were performed&mdash;services in which the visiting Indians
took little interest. Wrapped in profound and solemn
thought, they waited until the minister had concluded,
and then some arose to address their own countrymen
in their own language. Several orators recounted the
virtues and exploits of the dead Chief, and of the deeds
of their Great Nation, and, as they looked about them,
tears trickled down the cheeks of the last of the Senecas,
for there around them was only the miserable remnant
of a once glorious nation.</p>

<p>Red Jacket was buried in the little mission burying
ground, at the gateway of what once had been an
American fortification. A simple shaft of granite was
erected to mark his grave, and the spot became a resort
for travellers from far and near. Upon the tombstone
was cut the following inscription:</p>

<p>This headstone was desecrated by relic hunters until
the name disappeared from the marble. The famous
chieftain's body was afterwards removed to Buffalo,
where, at the home of his own people, it remained unburied
for many years, as they&mdash;knowing that his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
wish was not to rise among the palefaces&mdash;did not care
to allow him to lie among the members of a race which
he disliked.</p>

<p>Recently a splendid monument has been erected to
the great Seneca at Buffalo. A statue on top of the
shaft is a fitting tribute to this great orator of the redskins,
this man of masterful speech and noble form, who&mdash;like
Daniel Webster&mdash;could sway the thoughts of his
hearers by the magic of his utterance and the fascination
of his thought. His body now rests among those of a
different race, but his name still lives in the annals of
American history as the one Chief whose logic and
reasoning was, in a measure, equal to that of the all-conquering
Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN JOSEPH BRANT: THE WARRIOR CHIEF OF THE MOHAWKS</h2>


<p>In the State of New York, the Mohawk Valley is one
of the most fertile and productive spots. Here
are rolling fields of grain; wide orchards of apples,
pears, and cherries; crystal streams and forests of noble
trees. The soil is dark and loamy, and rich in nutritious
salts. It is the garden spot of that great and populous
state, and here the farmers are well content to remain
upon their ancestral acreage and to reside in their comfortable
houses. They are a happy people, blessed
with climate and natural resources that are unsurpassed.</p>

<p>But this fruitful vale was not always in the hands
of the descendants of Scotch, English and Irish forebears.
The Mohawk Indians once roamed at will in
this splendid country, here erected their wigwams
where the game was most plentiful, and here planted
orchards of apples and pears. The struggle for the
possession of the ground was long and bitter. Hundreds
gave up their lives in the wars which ravaged the
fertile valley, and where now one hears but the songs
of robins, of orioles, and of thrushes, once echoed the
screams of dying men, of women, and children, who
battled for the lands of the Mohawk. The waters of the
tributaries of the rippling stream once ran red with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
blood of contending armies of white men and of those
of another color.</p>

<p>A famous Chief&mdash;King Hendrick&mdash;ruled over the
destinies of the Mohawk Indians when Sir William
Johnson, an Irish Baronet, obtained a grant to a great
tract of territory here, and came to live in America.
By right of conquest the English claimed possession
of this soil, and by right of conquest the King deeded
it to anyone whom he chose to make a present to. Sir
William built a fine house and treated the Indians so
well that they came to like him and would often visit
him in great numbers.</p>

<p>King Hendrick was one day at the Baronet's house,
and seeing a richly embroidered coat lying across a chair,
he had a strong desire to possess it. So upon the following
morning he went up to Sir William and said:</p>

<p>"Brother, me dream last night a big dream."</p>

<p>"Really, Hendrick," replied Sir William. "And
what, pray, did my red brother dream?"</p>

<p>The King of the Mohawks pointed to the embroidered
coat.</p>

<p>"Me dream that the big coat was mine."</p>

<p>Sir William smiled. "It is yours," said he. "Take
it and wear it as a proof of my friendship for you."</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the jovial Baronet visited the
wigwams of the Mohawks, and, after lighting the peace
pipe, spoke to King Hendrick in the following manner.</p>

<p>"Great Sachem," said he, "I had a big dream last
night."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh!" grunted the Mohawk brave. "What
did my paleface brother dream?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The Irishman took up a stick and drew with it upon
the ground. "I dreamed that this tract of land was
mine," said he, describing a square bounded on the
south by the Mohawk river, on the east by Canada
Creek, and on the north and west by some well-known
hills. "And I would like to have my red-skinned brother
present it to me."</p>

<p>Old Hendrick was completely undone, for he saw that
this request covered nearly a hundred thousand acres of
the finest territory in his possession. But he remembered
the gift of that splendid scarlet coat, and, as he
thought over the matter, he came to the conclusion that
the request was not, after all, such a great one. Finally
he arose and stretched out his right arm in the direction
of the territory which the Irishman wanted.</p>

<p>"Brother," said he, "the land is yours, but you must
never dream again."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the title to this property was confirmed
by the British Government, and the tract was
called the Royal Grant. Sir William thus became one
of the largest landholders in America and one of the
most prominent Englishmen on the frontier. He
trafficked with the Senecas and Mohawks, made a large
fortune, and soon erected another mansion, called
"The Castle." Here he lived with a fair-haired German
girl whom he had married, and was happy and contented
until her death. She left him with three small
children&mdash;one a boy, John, and the others daughters.</p>

<p>Not long after his wife's death Sir William went to a
muster of the county militia. A pretty, daring Mohawk
girl of about sixteen years of age, called Mollie Brant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
stood among the crowd of spectators, and, engaging in
some banter with a field officer, asked if she might mount
his horse. Not dreaming, for an instant, that the girl
could do it, the officer gave his permission, and in a
second the girl had sprung to the crupper behind the
soldier, and they both dashed gayly over the parade
ground, while the maiden's bright blanket flapped
wildly in the wind. All laughed at this show of feminine
bravery, and Colonel Johnson was so much struck with
the beauty of the Indian maid that he requested that he
be presented to her.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Sir William asked the Indian beauty
to go with him to his home and become its mistress,
a request which she was only too willing to accede to.
For the remainder of his life Molly Brant lived with him;
an alliance which greatly pleased the Indians and
strengthened his influence over them. Johnson Hall
and Johnson Castle were always open to the coming and
going of crowds of red men. Sir William attended their
councils, danced in their wild dances, played their
games, and joined with them in all their wild sports.
He was given an Indian name, was formally adopted
into the Mohawk nation, and was made a war chief.
Frequently he would wear the dress of the redskins,
would paint his face, dress his head with eagle feathers,
and would march with great dignity and gravity into
Albany at the head of his adopted people.</p>

<p>The brother of Molly Brant was called Thay-en-da-negea,
or Joseph, and he was born upon the banks of
the Ohio River when the Mohawks had journeyed
thither upon a hunting expedition. The father of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
noted warrior had the extraordinary title of Te-ho-wagh-wen-gara-gh-kwin;
and, although his name is
not particularly beautiful, it is said that he was a Chief
of poetic nature and that he would often recite the
following legend concerning the ancestry of his famous
son and daughter.</p>

<p>"Many years in the past when the beautiful Mohawk
River was broader than at present, and when the falls
were more lofty, a feud arose between two young chiefs
of the respective clans of the Mohawk nation, the Wolf
and the Tortoise. The cause of the trouble was a maiden
of the Bear totem, for she was loved by the two youthful
braves of the Wolf and the Tortoise, and both desired
to make her his wife. Each was a noble young man, for
each had fought the Mingoes and the Mohegans and
each considered that he had shown sufficient bravery
to win the hand of the beautiful young maiden.</p>

<p>"Finally the maiden decided to bestow her hand upon
the warrior of the Wolf totem, and she promised him that
she would become his bride. But when this decision
was brought to the ears of the Tortoise, his heart burned
with jealousy, and he determined to carry off the beautiful
girl by force. So he persuaded her one night to go
with him to a verdant island in the river, where there
was a cooling spring, where the fireflies lighted the way
with their lamps, and where the whippoorwills sang their
evening serenades. They launched into the stream, but,
instead of paddling to the island, the warrior of the
Tortoise clan steered his canoe far down the stream,
and suddenly wheeling aside landed at the mouth of
a cavern known only to himself. Springing ashore, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
carried the unwilling maid inside, where the floor was
covered with rushes and skins of wild beasts, and where
an abundance of provisions was stored. A fierce
cataract was near by, so that anyone leaving by a canoe
would be swept away and drowned in its boiling flood.
But in the top of the cave was an exit, known alone to
the Tortoise.</p>

<p>"In the cave lived the maiden for many months, unhappy,
weeping, and sad. But he of the Wolf clan was
upon her trail, and one day&mdash;while hunting in the woods
in search of game&mdash;he saw the canoe at the mouth of
the cave and knew that she whom he loved must be
inside. The evening was clear and a full moon shed its
lustre over the woodland as the Wolf crept to the mouth
of the cavern and saw the Tortoise sleeping lightly upon
a bearskin. Dropping to his side, he struck him with
his knife. In a moment the warrior was upon his feet,
but, unable to find his hatchet in the dark, he bounded
through the opening at the top of the cavern and rolled
a huge stone over the exit.</p>

<p>"The lovers embraced in momentary joy, but it was
brief, as they realized that they were trapped in the cave,
and that soon the Tortoise would be back again to slay
them, accompanied by other warriors of his clan. There
was but one chance to escape&mdash;to plunge through the roaring
cataract in the canoe and to endeavor to cross the
boiling rapids in safety. So with an affectionate embrace,
they leaped into the frail barque and pointed it
towards the frothing spume of the waterfall. In an
instant they were being hurled through space in the
awful current of the water. But the Great Spirit was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
with them, and down the broad stream they glided, far
away to the margin of a lake, where they landed, built
a tepee and lived for two generations. Here they saw
their own children and their childrens' children go out
to war and to the chase. Here was born the father of
Joseph and Molly Brant, the first, the strong Wolf of the
Mohawks, the second, the distinguished wife of the great
Englishman, Sir William Johnson."</p>

<p>Thay-en-da-negea means a bundle of sticks, but why
the future Chieftain of the Mohawks was called by this
name it is difficult to know. Sir William Johnson
naturally took a great interest in him and sent him to
school at Lebanon, Connecticut, where he was taught by
a good old minister, called the Rev. Eleazer Wheelock,
and received a thorough knowledge of the English
language. "Joseph is indeed an excellent youth,"
wrote the aged minister to Sir William. "He is always
well, is studious and diligent."</p>

<p>When thirteen years of age, war broke out between
the French and English colonies in America, which resulted
in the conquest of Canada. With two of his
brothers, Joseph Brant was present at the fighting
around Crown Point in 1755. He confessed that he
was seized with fear and trembling at the first firing, and
was obliged to take hold of a small sapling, but recovered
his courage and fought bravely during the rest of the
day, seeking to win the reputation of a brave man, so
highly prized by every red man of ambition. Young
Thay-en-da-negea was also present at the siege of Fort
Niagara by Sir William Johnson's men, and so it can be
easily seen that as a youth he had a pretty thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
education as a warrior; an education which was to stand
him in good stead in the war of the American Revolution.
As a school boy he was restless and uneasy, preferring
to hunt rather than study. He did not graduate, and,
after leaving the tuition of the Rev. Mr. Wheelock, was
employed as an interpreter for a young minister who
was devoting his life to missionary work among the
Mohawks. Pontiac's war put an end to this duty, and he
was soon engaged in various forays against Indian tribes
which were upon the warpath.</p>

<p>Brant was a tall, handsome young Indian, with a
lighter complexion than most of his race, and a very
brilliant eye. In the light costume of an Indian warrior
he would often creep with his companions upon the war
parties of unfriendly savages, kill those whom they
could, and, with the prisoners bound and guarded, would
march triumphantly to their own village, and from
there to Johnson Hall to receive approbation and perhaps
a reward from Sir William; for he at one time
offered fifty dollars apiece for the heads of two chiefs
of the Delawares. The war was soon over, as has been
shown in the essay on Pontiac, and young Brant was now
well known as a brave, and well on the road to the
chieftaincy in coming battles.</p>

<p>In 1765 the famous warrior married the daughter of
an Oneida chief and settled at Canajoharie on the
Mohawk River, the middle town of three Mohawk
settlements and the home of his childhood. Here he
had a comfortable house with all the needed furniture.
In 1771 his wife died of consumption, and after this he
came to live at Fort Hunter, some thirty miles below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Canajoharie. He also joined the Church of England,
married his first wife's half-sister, and was living a peaceful
and quiet existence when the storm of the American
Revolution broke over the rural settlements of the
Mohawk.</p>

<p>There the white settlers were not all friendly to the
American Colonists. Believing that they were harshly
used by Great Britain, and seeing that they were
taxed without representation, they desired to cast off
the yoke of the mother country. Those who did not
desire a Revolution were called Tories. Those who were
for the American cause were known as Whigs. Sir
William Johnson was wealthy; he was not affected by
the English tax on tea; he had received great favors
from the mother country, and he, therefore, threw his
influence in behalf of King George: the burly English
Sovereign who was fully determined to whip the Americans
into submission. Joseph Brant was now one of the
most powerful and influential of the Iroquois and Mohawk
Chiefs. His close allegiance to the hospitable
Baronet naturally made him favor the same cause which
his sister's husband espoused. But before the Whigs
were sure which side the Indian warrior would champion,
they asked his old schoolmaster in Connecticut to write
him upon the subject, and to find out whether or no this
now powerful Indian would take up the tomahawk
against them.</p>

<p>When Joseph Brant received the epistle from good
old Wheelock, he answered it with characteristic wit.
"I remember," said he, "many happy hours that I
spent under your roof, dear Doctor, and I especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
remember the family prayers. There you used to pray
on bended knee and ask that we all might be able to
live as good subjects; to fear God and to honor the King.
How is it, then, that you now no longer wish to honor
the very man for whom you used to pray?" To this
the now aged schoolmaster made no reply, nor could he
have done so.</p>

<p>"When I joined the English at the beginning of this
war," said Brant, some years afterwards, "it was purely
on account of my forefathers' engagements with the
King. I always looked upon these covenants between
the King and the Indian nations as a sacred thing;
therefore, I was not to be frightened by the threats of
rebels at the time!" Thus the English gained the
allegiance, not only of this able warrior, but also of all the
fighting men whom he controlled. "I will lead three
thousand braves to battle for the cause of England,"
cried Brant in London, where he was now sent by Sir
William Johnson, "and with our assistance, there can be
but one end of the war&mdash;England will conquer."</p>

<p>No wonder he was popular at the English Capital.
When he appeared at court he wore a gorgeous Indian
costume; tall plumes adorned his headdress; silver
bands were around his sinewy arms, his dress was of the
richest texture, and copper pendants hung from his
clothing. In his belt of blue, red and white beads, a
long glittering tomahawk was fastened upon which
was engraved, "J. Thay-en-da-negea." He was the
lion of the London season. His portrait was twice
painted; jewelled ladies sought an audience with him;
while the famous Boswell wrote much about this eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
redskin in the papers of the period. But in spite of all
this flattery, he seems to have been undismayed by what
he saw and to have had the good sense to buy a gold
ring, upon which was engraved his full name, so that he
could be identified if slain in battle. And of war he
was soon to see enough to satisfy the martial spirit of
any Indian warrior.</p>

<p>The people of New York were waiting to capture this
prominent brave when he returned to his own land,
but he was too shrewd for them and escaped the clutches
of those who would do him harm. Landing near the
city of New York in a small boat, he carefully hid himself
by day, and journeying by night, soon had reached
a less populated country. Finally he came to Canada,
was received most cordially by the British officers, and
soon had collected a large band of Indians which he
put at the disposal of Sir Guy Carleton, then commander
of the British troops on Canadian soil. He
was ordered to join forces with a company of regulars,
with six hundred Iroquois, and to dislodge some American
troops from a point of land about forty miles above
Montreal, known as the Cedars.</p>

<p>The Americans were unable to hold their own against
the superior numbers of their enemies. They capitulated,
and, although a number of troops&mdash;under General
Arnold&mdash;came to their assistance, these were defeated
by Brant and his Iroquois with great loss. The savages
murdered many of the prisoners before they could be
prevented, although Brant endeavored to stop them.
He did succeed in saving the life of Captain McKinstry,
who was badly wounded, and who had been selected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>by the Indians to be roasted alive. By making up a
purse among the officers an ox was purchased for the
bloodthirsty braves, which they roasted instead of the
officer, and, as the latter was treated with great kindness
by Brant, he became a firm friend of the young
Mohawk Chieftain. In after years, when the war was
over, Brant never passed down the Hudson without
visiting the gallant captain at his home, a visit which
the American greatly appreciated as can well be imagined.</p>

<p>Cherry Valley in Otsego County, New York, is one
of the most beautiful and fertile sections of the state, so
fertile that hundreds of white settlers had here taken
up plantations. Their consternation was great when
they learned in 1777 that Brant with a large force of
Iroquois and Mohawks had determined to attack them.
From Oquaga on the Susquehanna the red men approached
the settlements one bright morning in May,
and from the thick woods glared upon the largest fortification
of the settlement, in front of which some boys
were parading with swords of wood and guns of the
same material. Luckily the Indian Chief thought that
these were real soldiers, and fearing to attack he withdrew.</p>

<p>But soon two young men&mdash;Lieutenant Wormwood
and Peter Sitz&mdash;rode into the wood, where his Indians
were in hiding. The former had just galloped
over from the Mohawk Valley to tell the people
that troops would soon be sent to them, as assistance,
and the other had some exaggerated dispatches
upon his person, stating that the defenses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
fort were twice as strong as they really were. It was
fortunate that he had these with him, for, as they
were captured by Brant and his men, these bogus
dispatches made the Indians desist in an attack upon the
stockade in Cherry Valley. Wormwood was killed by
a volley from the guns of the savages and was scalped,
an act which Brant is said to have much regretted, as
he had formerly been friendly with the young man.
Sitz was allowed to go, although the Mohawks were eager
to torture him.</p>

<p>The Indians continued to flock to the standard of
Joseph Brant, and the people of the frontier were in
terror of their lives. Hastily they formed a militia
and placed the raw recruits under the command of a
lean, clean-limbed frontiersman called Herkimer, who
was an old neighbor and friend of Joseph Brant. This
soldier determined if possible to capture the wily brave,
and so, inviting him to an interview, he marched out with
three hundred men to meet him at Unadilla. When
he had arrived there, a messenger came in from the camp
of the Indians.</p>

<p>"Captain Brant wants to know why you came here?"
said the Mohawk.</p>

<p>Herkimer looked firmly at him. "I merely came to
see and talk with my brother, Captain Brant," he
answered.</p>

<p>The Indian gazed suspiciously around at the hard-visaged
militiamen.</p>

<p>"Do all these men want to talk with Captain Brant
also?" he asked. "I will carry your big talk to Captain
Brant," he continued, "but you must not come any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
farther." So saying, he made off towards the camp of
the Indians.</p>

<p>A meeting was now appointed through messengers to
take place about midway between the two small armies.
Herkimer hurried to the place of council, but had to
wait a long time for Brant and his warriors, who showed
by their actions that they suspected treachery. Herkimer,
himself, scarcely disguised his intense dislike for
the Indian warrior, as he looked into the keen eyes of
the famous redskin.</p>

<p>"May I inquire the reason of my being honored by a
visit from such an eminent man as yourself?" asked
Brant politely.</p>

<p>"I came upon a friendly errand," said Herkimer.
"I want to know whether you intend to ally yourself
with the British or not?"</p>

<p>Brant looked at him defiantly. "The Indians are in
concert with the King, as their fathers were," said he.
"We have still got the wampum belt which the King
gave us, and we cannot break our word. You and your
followers have joined the Boston people against your
sovereign. And, although the Bostonians are resolute,
the King will humble them. Your General Schuyler
has been too smart for the Indians in his treaty with
them. He tricked the unsuspecting braves. The Indians
have made war before upon the white people when
they were all united; now they are divided, and the
Indians are not frightened, for they know that they
can beat you."</p>

<p>"I want you to give up the Tories in your party,"
said Herkimer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"I refuse to do so," answered Brant. "If all you
want to do is to see the poor Indians, why, pray, do you
bring all these white soldiers with you?"</p>

<p>So the conference ended, but the Indian Chief promised
to meet Herkimer again next day. Meanwhile the
frontiersman determined to massacre the Chief and his
attendants when again they met. Four of his soldiers
were chosen to do this, but when the time came they
lost heart, and, overawed by the numbers of red warriors,
failed to take the life of Brant, who met Herkimer at
the appointed time, with five hundred warriors at his
heels. The white man only had a dozen militiamen to
guard him.</p>

<p>"I have five hundred of my best men with me, all
armed and ready for battle," said the Mohawk. "You,
Herkimer, are in my power, but, as we have been friends
and neighbors, I will not take advantage over you."
As he spoke he signalled with his hand, and with a wild,
blood-curdling warwhoop, his warriors swept around the
spot where stood the frontier leader.</p>

<p>"Now, Herkimer," said Brant imperiously, "you
and your men may go."</p>

<p>The militiamen took the hint and turning about made
off into the forest as fast as their legs would carry them.</p>

<p>Brant and his men withdrew from Cherry Valley and
marched to meet an army under General Burgoyne, which,
concentrating at Lake Champlain, was beginning an advance
into the interior of the State of New York. "We
cannot be beaten," said the British leader. "We will
split the Colonies in two parts, and they will soon
capitulate." So with confidence and zeal the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
force of English regulars and hostile Indians crept down
upon the American settlements. The farmers armed
for the defense of their principles. They gathered in
bands to stem the hostile invasion, and, if possible, to
defeat the great and powerful force of the English.</p>

<p>On the Mohawk River the wooden palisades of Fort
Stanwix offered somewhat of an obstacle to the progress
of the British regulars. Brave Colonel Gansevoort,
who commanded it, swore that he would perish rather
than capitulate to the enemies of the American Colonists,
but, as the fortifications were weak and the garrison was
in peril, a body of militia from the Mohawk Valley
marched to its relief. Early in August this force of
armed frontiersmen&mdash;under rough old Herkimer&mdash;started
through the forest to succor those who held the
place, while one of Burgoyne's generals (St. Ledger)
sent a considerable body of troops and Indians to meet
the New York farmers. Brant was in command of the
detachment of savages, and, realizing from past experience
the militiamen would come rather heedlessly through
the forest, he planned an ambuscade. Near a rough
bridge, crossing a low, swampy piece of ground, he
placed his Indians in hiding. In a wide circle they hid
around the brush upon the opposite side of the bridge.</p>

<p>As Herkimer's rough followers came slowly through
the dense woodland, they little suspected that the Mohawks
and Iroquois were crouching there before them,
eager and ready to precipitate themselves upon their
straggling line. The Americans were even singing, so
secure did they feel, and some stopped at the stream
to drink. The main body, however, pushed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
clearing beyond, and all had crossed, except the wagon
train and the rear guard, when, with a blood-curdling
yell, the followers of Brant rushed to their rear so as to
stop their retreat across the bridge, and began to pour
a murderous fire into the startled Americans.</p>

<p>"Drop to the ground, men," shouted old Herkimer.
"Fight the devils from behind the trees. Make every
bullet count, and never give in!"</p>

<p>His counsel was only too much needed, for at the first
Indian volley every American in the advance guard had
been killed. The rest, crouching low upon the sod, took
deliberate aim at the yelping Mohawks, and soon held
them at bay. Again and again the frontiersmen attempted
to get through the hostile line. Again and
again they were driven back. A bullet struck grim
Herkimer's steed and knocked him to the ground.
Another hit the dauntless frontiersman in the leg and
splintered the bone. But in spite of the pain in his
wound he crawled to a tree, propped himself against it
with his face to the enemy, and coolly taking out his
tinder box, lighted his pipe. "Pray take yourself to
the rear and out of harm's way," cried one of his aids
when he saw the bullets crashing around his commander.
"No, I will not move," said old Herkimer,
with calm decision. "An American general always
faces the enemy. Place two of our men behind each
tree, for I note that when one man is alone the red devils
run in and tomahawk him, after he has discharged his
musket. Tell one of them to always reserve his load
until after the first one has fired. That will keep old
neighbor Brant in check."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>The fight had now lasted about an hour, and the
Americans were holding their own against the British
and Indians, whose wild yells and warwhoops did not
inspire them with much terror. But suddenly a tremendous
thunder shower burst upon the struggling
masses of humanity, and deep roars of the elements,
fierce flashes of lightning, and ominous crashings of
branches put an end to hostilities. The frightful
raging of the storm drowned the yelping and groaning
of the combatants. A deluging flood of water poured
from the inky clouds, wetting the powder of both
Indians and whites, and rendering many of the guns
useless. The Indians were awed by the frightful noise
of the elements, and, in sullen rage, the dark warriors
of Joseph Brant withdrew from the firing line to a safe
distance. The Americans, meanwhile, took a more
advantageous position and waited with confidence for
the renewal of the fight. Their wagons were wheeled
in a circle and they crouched by them, determined that
death would overtake them before they would surrender.</p>

<p>When the storm subsided, the Mohawks again rushed
into the fray, assisted by some soldiers from Johnson
Hall, called Johnson's Greens. These men were all
neighbors of Herkimer's Americans, and as they came
on, those who favored the cause of the Colonies could
not resist the temptation to attack their former companions
with fixed bayonets. The Greens stood their
ground, until, with clubbed muskets, the Americans
beat them to earth, while some, in deadly embrace,
rolled upon the sod and were shot to death by the
Indian warriors. The fighting was furious. Fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
shouts rose above the crack of the muskets, while
above the sound of the struggling men could be heard
the calm voice of old Herkimer, saying:</p>

<p>"Be cool, boys, be cool. But lick 'em for the Great
Jehovah and the Continental Congress."</p>

<p>Thus continued the fierce battling in the wildwood,
when, suddenly, hoarse cheers arose from the Americans,
as with a rattle and roar two hundred men from the
garrison at Fort Stanwix burst through the forest and
precipitated themselves upon the British and Indians.
A wild yell went up as the New Yorkers drove the
Indians back, and with a sudden rush broke the English
formation. In disorganization and confusion, the allied
forces of invasion now withdrew, while, with loud yelps
of hatred, the followers of Joseph Brant also made off
into the gloom of the deep wood. The baggage and
provisions of the English were soon in the hands of the
victorious Americans, while several of their battle flags
were seized by the hardy frontiersmen from the valley
of the Mohawk. Surprise, temporary defeat, and disorganization
had been turned into a victory for the
grim-visaged followers of old Herkimer. The battle of
the Oriskanay had ended in repulse for the invaders.</p>

<p>Brant was now the most detested man in the border.
Those who had before been friendly to him prayed for
an opportunity to dispatch this venomous Indian.
But in spite of his evil reputation, he always denied
that he had ever committed any act of cruelty during
this savage war, and none has been proven against him,
while many stories of his mercy are well authenticated.
When Indians were accused of brutality, Brant would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
reply that the whites sometimes excelled the savages
in revengeful barbarity. He defended the Indian
mode of warfare, saying that the savages had neither
the artillery, the numbers, nor the prisons of the white
men, and that, as their forces were small, they had to use
stratagem in order to win.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1778&mdash;when every frontiersman
was in danger and all trembled for their lives&mdash;a boy
named William McKoun was one day raking hay alone
in a field. Turning suddenly around, he saw an Indian
near by, and raising his hayrake for protection, cried
out:</p>

<p>"Red man, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, young man, I sha'n't hurt you,"
said the Indian. "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"William McKoun," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a son of Captain McKoun, who lives in
the northeast part of the town, I suppose," continued
the savage. "I know your father very well. He is a
neighbor of Mr. Foster. Your father is a very fine fellow,
indeed. I know several more of your neighbors,
and they are fine men."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" the boy ventured to ask.</p>

<p>The Indian hesitated a moment, and then replied:
"My name is Brant."</p>

<p>"What, Captain Brant?" cried the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, I am a cousin of his," answered the great chief
(for it was Joseph Brant), as he turned to go away.
Thus, it can be seen that in the midst of war he was not
always the bloodthirsty savage.</p>

<p>Another incident well exhibited his merciful side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
for when in 1778 the allied troops, under Brant and an
Englishman named Butler, attacked the settlements in
Cherry Valley, the Mohawk Chieftain entered a house
where he found a white woman baking bread.</p>

<p>"How is it that you are doing this kind of work while
your neighbors are all being murdered around you?"
asked the great warrior.</p>

<p>"We are the King of England's people," exclaimed
the woman.</p>

<p>"That plea won't save you today," cried Brant,
"for my Indians are murdering everyone."</p>

<p>"There is one Joseph Brant who is a man of big
heart," exclaimed the woman. "If he is with the
Indians he will save us."</p>

<p>The warrior looked pleased. "I am Joseph Brant,"
said he. "But I am not in command, and I don't know
that I can save you. I will do what I can."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a band of Seneca braves approached
the house. "Get into bed and pretend that you are
ill," shouted Brant. And as she obeyed the Indians
entered.</p>

<p>"There is no one here but a sick woman and her children,"
cried the Chief. "Leave them alone, for they are
on the King's side."</p>

<p>After some talking the Senecas withdrew, and when
they were out of sight Brant went to the door and
uttered a long, shrill yell. Immediately a dozen Mohawk
warriors came running across the fields.</p>

<p>"Here," cried their leader, "take some of our paint
and put your mark upon this woman and her children."
And as they obeyed he said to her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madam, you are now safe, as all the Senecas and
Mohawks will understand and respect this sign. Good-bye
and good luck to you."</p>

<p>The allied forces of Butler and Brant captured thirty
or forty prisoners in Cherry Valley, but they could not
seize the fort, which was well defended by numerous
frontiersmen. So marching off with the plunder which
they had collected, they soon were back in their own
territory. The women and children whom they had
captured were exchanged next year for British prisoners
among the Americans, but in 1778 Brant and Sir William
Johnson again advanced through the Schoharie and
Mohawk Valleys, on a campaign of destruction, plunder,
and revenge. Burgoyne's army had been defeated.
Stout, courageous old Herkimer had died of his wounds
after the bloody battle of the Oriskanay, but the English
cause was not dead by any means, and the Indians
were still upon the warpath.</p>

<p>The English, Senecas and Mohawks numbered sixteen
hundred men, and, as they marched into Wyoming
Valley, the people took refuge in a structure known as
"Forty Fort," while the old men, boys, and a few veteran
soldiers who were home on furlough marched out to
meet the invaders. The Americans were well armed,
were led by an excellent officer, and were fighting for
the protection of their homes. Before the opening of
the battle, strong spirits were distributed among the
defenders, and as a number of the frontiersmen indulged
too freely in whiskey and brandy, it helped to defeat the
patriot force. The battle opened with irregular firing,
but soon steady volleys were being poured into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
invaders by the Americans. The British gave way as
the Yankee troops advanced, but in the heat of the
fray several orders were misunderstood, and the line
became confused. At this crisis Johnson ordered a
charge of his Indians. With a wild, blood-curdling
screech, they precipitated themselves upon the defenders
of Wyoming, and soon, in hopeless rout, the Americans
were broken into shreds. They were struck down right
and left and tomahawked as they fell. The fort itself was
next in the hands of the Tories and Indians, who, on a
promise that no one would be harmed if they surrendered,
gained an entrance to their stout defense. The women
and children inside were tomahawked with ruthless
slaughter, and with wild yells of delight the followers of
Johnson and Brant danced around the hapless victims
of war.</p>

<p>Unwilling to trust themselves to the plighted word of
a Tory or Indian, some of the patriots plunged into the
forest and made their way to the American settlements
on the Upper Delaware. Many died of starvation on
the way. The woods through which they went have
been thus called "The Shades of Death," for, as they
plunged onward to Stroudsburg and other havens of
safety, in their ears rang the loud screams of their wives
and children, while on their brains were engraved the
awful sight of burning houses, murdered patriots and
wild savages dancing in their warpaint. The massacre
of Wyoming was one of the most fiendish in the annals
of border fighting.</p>

<p>Brant was now known as the Monster. Historians
have stated that he was not engaged in this campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and that the Indians were Senecas and not Mohawks.
At any rate, he was near the scene of slaughter, for, four
months later, he was in a foray into Cherry Valley.
In a massacre during this raid a man named Major
Wood was about to be killed, when, either by accident
or design, he made a Masonic signal, although he did not
belong to this order. When Brant saw it, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Brother! you shall not die. I am a Mason and will
protect you." So he stayed the tomahawk and set the
fellow free. It is said that the captive felt under obligations
to join the order immediately after his release
from the clutches of the hostile Indians.</p>

<p>The summer of 1779 had now come. The Colonists
had regained their courage and were determined to put
an end to these Indian invasions. So, placing General
Sullivan in command of their outposts, they allowed
him to strike the Indians in his own manner. This
able soldier, dividing his army into three divisions, advanced
into the land of the Senecas and Mohawks.
His left moved from Pittsburg under Colonel Broadhead;
his right from the Mohawk River under General
James Clinton, while he, himself, led the centre from
Wyoming. Sullivan met the English and Indians
under Brant, where now stands the city of Elmira,
New York. The Americans outnumbered the enemy
and attacked with fury. The Indians fought courageously,
but they could not stem the rush of the Colonials,
who wished to revenge the massacre of Wyoming.
The Mohawks, Iroquois and Senecas were killed by the
hundreds. So many fell that the sides of the rocks
next to the river appeared as if blood had been poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
over them by pailfuls. And soon seeing that all was
lost, the Indian warriors fled from their fertile country,
leaving their territory with its populous and well-laidout
villages, its vast fields of waving grain, and its
magnificent orchards, to be destroyed by the patriots.</p>

<p>More than forty villages were laid in ruins. The
famous apple orchards were cut down, and these were
the product of the toil and care of generations of Iroquois.
"Alas," said one old Mohawk brave. "A
wigwam can be built in two or three days, but a tree
takes many years to grow again." So great, indeed,
was the destruction that a peace party arose among the
Indians, led by the famous Red Jacket. With great
eloquence he spoke of the folly of war, which they had
fought for the English, and for which they had been
driven from their beautiful valley. "What have the
English ever done for us," he exclaimed, "that we
should become homeless and helpless wanderers for their
sakes?" So strong, indeed, was this appeal that
secretly it was determined to send a runner to the
American army in order to gain peace at any terms.</p>

<p>When Brant heard of this, he summoned two Mohawk
warriors to his camp. "This runner must never
reach the camp of the Americans," he cried. "See that
he dies on the way!" So the expectant Senecas and other
malcontents waited in vain for the answering message
from Sullivan and his men. A reply to their proposals
never came, for the bearer of their words of resignation
was lying behind some great rock in the forest with a
tomahawk in his brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>In October, 1780, the Mohawks had so greatly regained
their courage that with the assistance of Tory
troops, under Butler, they again descended upon the
settlements of the Mohawk Valley. Houses and barns
were burned; horses and cattle were either killed or
driven off, and those who did not fly to the protection
of the stockade were tomahawked. As the Americans
pushed through the woods one day, nine stout English
soldiers were running through the brush. It was fairly
dark, and when they suddenly heard a stern voice cry,
"Lay down your arms," they were suddenly aware that
they had run into the enemy. Fearing that Sullivan
himself was there, they all threw down their arms and
capitulated. They were securely bound and led off
to a little blockhouse, where, as day dawned they found,
to their chagrin, that their captors were seven militiamen
of the American army.</p>

<p>But the invaders were not to have everything their
own way, for soon the Americans, under Colonels Rowley
and Willet, met them near Johnson Hall. The fighting
was furious; so furious on the part of the patriots
that the enemy retreated to West Canada Creek, where
they encamped. It was the ground which old Hendrick
had sold for an embroidered coat, but next day it ran
red with the blood of the old chief's descendants. Butler
was shot and fell mortally wounded by the bullet of
an Oneida Indian, who bounded towards him with his
tomahawk raised aloft. "Save me," cried the craven
Butler, who, himself, had murdered hundreds of Americans.
"Give me quarter."</p>

<p>"Hah!" cried the Oneida brave. "I will give you
Cherry Valley quarter," and so saying he buried his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
hatchet in the brain of the enemy, leaving his body
as a prey to the wild denizens of the forest, who soon
consumed it.</p>

<p>The place of this fierce fighting is to this day called
Butler's Ford, and here the Tories and Indians made
their last stand against the Colonists. Soon a treaty
of peace had been signed between America and England,
and this fierce border warfare was to come to an end.</p>

<p>Brant was not forgotten by the English Monarch, and
he was given a fine tract of land on the western side of
Lake Ontario, where he made his home, had an excellent
house, and lived in the manner of an Englishman.
Invited again to London, he there was asked to a
masquerade, and, as he needed no mask, went in his
native costume, with his tomahawk in his belt and his
face painted vermilion. There were some Turks
present at the ball, and one seemed to be very much
interested in Brant's face. He examined it very
closely, and at last raised his hand and pulled the
Chief's long Roman nose, supposing it to be a mask.
Immediately Brant gave a loud, piercing warwhoop,
swung his glistening tomahawk around the head of the
startled Mohammedan, and almost brought it down
upon his turbanned skull. Ladies shrieked and fainted.
Waiters fell on each other in a wild endeavor to get
away. Champagne glasses and fragile plates crashed
upon the floor. All was confusion and uproar until,
smiling broadly, the well-known Mohawk brave placed
his weapon again in his belt, exclaiming: "Ugh! I
would not hurt you for anything. I only wanted to
scare you as I did the Americans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Under half pay as an English officer, the well-known
Mohawk Chieftain held a commission of colonel from the
King of England, although he was usually called Captain.
He encouraged missionaries to come among his
people, lived gorgeously with a retinue of thirty negro
servants, and took great interest in the progress of his
tribe. Yet his life was not an entirely easy one, as
numerous enemies plotted against his life. One Dutchman,
whose entire family had been killed by Brant's
warriors in the Mohawk Valley, swore revenge against
him and shadowed him by day and night, awaiting an
opportunity to kill him. And he nearly did so in New
York, where the Mohawk Chief had taken a room at a
hotel which fronted on Broadway. Looking out of his
window, he saw this infuriated settler aiming a gun at
him from the opposite side of the street, but, as luck
would have it, a Colonial officer saw the act, and running
to the angry Dutchman, took his gun away from him
before he could fire it.</p>

<p>This was not the only attempt against the life of
the noted Indian brave. He was shot at one day when
walking through the streets, by an unseen enemy in
an old outhouse. Startled by this, he planned to return
to Canada through the Mohawk Valley, but was told
that he would be assassinated if he did so. He, therefore,
changed his course and went home by vessel along
the coast. In New York State he was detested and
hated. Men remembered the awful butcheries of his
Mohawks and the carnage of the battles in this state,
and had Brant ever ventured among them, he would
never have gotten away alive. Sorrowed by events and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
seeing the gradual disintegration of his tribe, the celebrated
warrior spent his declining years in sadness and
regret. "Colonel Brant is a man of education," wrote
Aaron Burr. "He speaks English perfectly and has seen
much of England and America. Receive him with
respect and hospitality. He is not one of those Indians
who drink, but is quite a gentleman; one, in fact, who
understands and practices what belongs to propriety
and good breeding."</p>

<p>A remarkable piece of work by this renowned warrior
was the translation of the Gospel of John and the Book
of Common Prayer into the Mohawk language, copies
of which are in the Harvard University. His wife, a
half-breed, refused to conform to civilized life, and
finally removed to a wigwam, taking some of her children
with her and leaving others at her former home.
The great chief, himself, died in 1807, at the age of
sixty-four years, saying to a white friend with his last
breath: "Have pity on the poor Indian; if you have
any influence with the great Englishmen, endeavor to
do all the good that you can for the poor Mohawks."</p>

<p>Buried beside the church which he had built at Grand
River, the first church in Upper Canada, there now
stands a monument over his grave, said to have cost
thirty thousand dollars. Upon it is the following
inscription:</p>

<p>"This tomb is erected to the memory of Thay-en-da-negea,
or Captain Joseph Brant, principal chief and
warrior of the Six Nation Indians, by his fellow subjects,
and admirers of his fidelity and attachment to the
British Crown."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The civilization of the white man now sweeps by the
last resting place of the red warrior of the Mohawk
Valley. His tribe has vanished; his reputation belongs
to the ages.</p>

<h2>LITTLE TURTLE, OR MICHIKINIQUA: THE MIAMI CONQUEROR OF HARMAR AND ST. CLAIR</h2>


<p>Very few Indian warriors have ever defeated the
forces of whites sent against them more than
once. Nor have many of them exhibited the
same talent for warfare that the English have shown.
The red man has never cared for discipline or tactics,
and has usually fought his battles in a haphazard
manner. But there has been one chieftain who has the
distinction of having defeated two separate armies
of Colonists, with numbers about equal to his own
braves. Judged from these successes in battle, and
from his sagacity in the council chamber, Little Turtle,
a Miami warrior, deserves a position of particular
prominence among the American red men of distinction.</p>

<p>When the American Revolution came to an end, the
Mississippi River was the western boundary of the
United States. Long after the conclusion of peace, the
British retained possession of several posts within the
limits of the property ceded to the Colonists in the
northern portion of the State of New York, and in Ohio
and Illinois. These log fortresses became rallying
points for the Indians who disliked the Americans, and
who, as the tide of emigration swept westward, determined
to check it. Although the British no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
fought against the Colonists, they sometimes supplied the
hungry savages with rations, and sustained by these the
Indians were aggressive, insolent, and sullen. The newly
formed Government of the United States made strenuous
attempts to pacify the wild tribes, and, for the most
part, was successful. But the Miami and Wabash
braves, under the leadership of Little Turtle, Blue
Jacket and Buckongahelas, formed a strong confederation
of Wyandots, Pottawattamies, Chippewas, Ottawas,
Shawnees, Delawares and Miamis, who resolved to stop
all white men from coming into their territory. Thirty
years before, these same tribes had united under the
leadership of Pontiac, and, although having a temporary
success against the whites, had finally been defeated,
as we have seen.</p>

<p>Exposed cabins and small settlements of the whites
were continually burned by the red men, and the adventurous
pioneers were slain whenever there was no
assistance near by. Flatboats upon the Ohio River
were never safe from Indian attacks, and had to run
by hidden redskins on the banks. Frequently they
were sunk by the enemy, although they had bullet-proof
sides.... Attempts to conciliate the savages were
met with insults, and, so in September, 1791, the President
of the United States directed an army to march
into the country of the Indians and defeat them.</p>

<p>In command of the American troops was General
Harmar, an able leader and an aggressive campaigner.
At Fort Washington, where Cincinnati now stands, he
gathered a force of three hundred and twenty regulars
and about twelve hundred militiamen, mostly untrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
woodsmen with little experience in border warfare.
Little Turtle was the most active leader among those
who opposed the invasion of the Ohio territory. He
won his position of chief at an early age by his skill and
bravery, for he possessed both in a marked degree.
His intelligence was very similar to that of his white
adversaries. His knowledge of the proper way to fight
in the tangled underbrush of the Ohio woodland was
supreme. His portrait exhibits a face in which quickness
and keenness of intellect are strongly marked.
His piercing black eyes look defiantly at the spectator
and burn with the fire of ambition and resolution.
He possessed every qualification for a leader of the wild
denizens of the Ohio country, and indulging in the
gloomy apprehension that the whites would overtop
and finally uproot his race, he was strong in his
denunciation of the Americans, and in his desire to
annihilate them.</p>

<p>On September 13, 1791, the troops under General
Harmar pushed into the Indian country, and soon
reached the villages of the Miamis. These were deserted,
so they were burned, the cornfields were cut
down, and the army camped upon the ground. On the
next day an Indian trail was discovered, so Harmar
ordered one hundred and fifty militiamen and thirty
regulars, with their officers, to push on ahead and defeat
the hostiles.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>Captain Armstrong, in charge of this expedition, was
a man of experience in border warfare, but he allowed
his entire command to walk into an ambush. The
troops were hot upon the Indian trail, when a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>wail from the forest was followed by the loud report of
a rifle on the right of the skirmish line. Immediately
a chorus of horrible yells arose from every quarter, and
before the Americans fully realized it they were surrounded
by a ring of spitting rifles. Men fell over each
other in confusion, and terrified by the suddenness of
the onslaught the militia broke ranks and fled. Armstrong,
himself, was knocked into a mire, and sinking
up to his neck in the bog was unable to take part in the
fighting. He could only see the terrible slaughter
among the regulars, all of whom were either killed or
disabled. And later on he saw the Indians holding a
savage war dance among the bodies of the slain.</p>

<p>Dragging himself out of the swamp at dark, the mud-bespattered
leader crept back to Harmar's camp,
while the doleful wails of the savages sounded loud in
the inky blackness. And when he arrived he found
that the American General had enough of Turtle's
tactics to suit him, apparently for all time. At any
rate he broke camp and retreated towards the settlements,
until he arrived near the ruined villages of the
Miamis. Here he ordered a halt and sent Colonel
Hardin back towards the Indians with only sixty
regulars and three hundred militiamen. These last
were pretty poor specimens of soldiers, as they had,
for the most part, been recruited in the Eastern states
from men of no experience whatever in woodland
fighting. They were undisciplined, untrained, and
unaccustomed to the frontier. Many had gone out to
fight in order to escape from legal difficulties at home.
Their ability to cope with the watchful enemy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
about equal to that of General Braddock's troops at
Fort Duquesne, and they met with about the same fate.</p>

<p>Hardin had no sooner arrived at the place he had
been directed to go to, when a small body of Miami
Indians advanced to meet his troops. These, by
yelling and firing, soon attracted the volleys of his own
men. As the militiamen advanced, the redskins broke
into several bands, and, appearing to be panic-stricken,
fled down a long gulley. In a twinkling the militia
started in pursuit, and were hurrying after the yelping
braves, when suddenly a vast number of warriors beset
the sixty regulars on all sides. Little Turtle directed
the fighting, and, realizing that his greater number
could soon annihilate the entire command, ordered a
rush upon the soldiers of the new Republic, who had now
formed a hollow square back to back, with bayonets at
the ends of their long muskets. But the Indians fought
like demons; rushed headlong against the glittering
steel; and throwing their tomahawks at the soldiers,
struck down those in front, while the others were soon
overpowered by the vastly superior forces of the enemy.
The militia, meanwhile, came straggling back from
their pursuit of the decoy Indians, and for a short
while made a fierce attack upon the savages. But now
realizing that the regulars were all killed, and being unaccustomed
to frontier fighting, they lost heart completely
and retreated. Ten regulars got away with
the mass of fugitives, and the dead were left as a prey to
the wolves and other animals of the wild wood.</p>

<p>Elated by their success, the Indians, under Little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Turtle and the other leaders, now continued their depredations
upon the frontier with greater audacity than
ever. Harmar retreated to Fort Washington, was
courtmartialed, and was honorably acquitted, but immediately
resigned his commission. His personal conduct
in the battles had been brave, and he claimed a
victory, because the warriors of Little Turtle had not
followed him up after the fight. Certainly he had
made the campaign in an extraordinary manner, for
never had he met the Indians with his entire force
intact. By splitting his command he had weakened
it badly, and thus the savages had been able to overpower
the separate detachments of his army. To the
sagacity of Little Turtle can be laid the Indian victory,
for his was the mind that had planned the ambuscade,
and he was the one who had given personal direction
to the annihilation of the regulars.</p>

<p>George Washington, who was then President of the
Republic, was mortified by this series of defeats to his
army, and the situation was now so grave that Congress
ordered the organization of a new force to punish the
savages. The Governor of the Northwest Territory,
General Arthur St. Clair, was put in command of fully
two thousand men and was directed to wipe out the
defeat of Harmar, by administering a crushing blow
to the followers of Little Turtle. Before he set out upon
his journey into the wilderness, President Washington
called him to Philadelphia and warned him to guard
against surprise by the Indians. "You have," said he,
"your instructions from the Secretary of War. The
Indians have a leader of great bravery in Little Turtle,
and have proven that they can fight with great strength.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
You know that they lay many ambuscades. <i>Beware
of a surprise!</i> I repeat it. <i>Beware of a surprise!</i>"
With these words of counsel ringing in his ears, St.
Clair left for Fort Washington, arriving there in May,
1791.</p>

<p>The leader of the American forces was a man of
considerable age, and was afflicted with gout and rheumatism.
In the war of the Revolution he had exhibited
no particular talent, but he possessed undoubted
courage. He had soon collected two small regiments
of regular infantrymen and some six months' levies of
militia, whose pay was two dollars and ten cents a
month for privates, and thirty dollars for captains.
The militiamen were utterly untrained in border warfare,
and their officers had had little experience, but the
regular troops were well used to Indian campaigns.
There were two small batteries of light guns and a few
cavalrymen to swell the fighting force, which amounted
in all to about two thousand warriors.</p>

<p>The levies of raw troops were gathered together at
Fort Hamilton, twenty-five miles north from Fort
Washington, and from this place an advance was begun
into the Indian country on October 4th. The little
army stumbled slowly through the deep woods and across
the open places, cutting out its own road and making
about five or six miles a day. As the wild beasts of the
forest were plentiful, frequently both deer and bear were
slaughtered, and venison helped to sustain the strength
of the men. Halting to build another fort, christened
in honor of Thomas Jefferson, the army again pressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>into the country of the hostiles, while the scouts occasionally
interchanged shots with parties of skulking
braves. Now and again a militiaman would disappear,
showing that the savages were closely watching the
movements of the column, while numerous desertions
cut the force down from its original numbers to fourteen
hundred men. Snow was on the ground, the
wintry woods surrounded the Americans with a bleak
and awful silence, the sickness of St. Clair made it impossible
for him to command in person, and had it not
been for the efforts of the Adjutant General, Colonel
Winthrop Sargent, an old Revolutionary officer, the
expedition would have failed ingloriously, even before
the Indians had been reached.</p>

<p>But now the army of invasion neared the Miami
settlements, where the redskins were making busy
preparation to give the Americans a warm reception.
They had met in a grand war council, at which the plan
of attack had been decided upon, and various tribes
had been given positions in the line. Little Turtle was
to be Commander-in-Chief, so he made a rousing speech,
telling the Indians to fight to the last ditch, to attack
the militia in preference to the regular troops, and to
rush the enemy in such masses that they would be overwhelmed.
An ambuscade was decided upon where
the ground was most favorable to the savages, and here
Little Turtle pointed out the proper positions which he
wished the various warlike bands to assume. The intelligent
Miami chief was not to take any position in
the line of battle, but was to direct the operations from
the rear, like a white general, and thus the Indians displayed
more foresight than usual; foresight which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
to tell with tremendous effect upon the illy disciplined
frontier detachments under St. Clair.</p>

<p>On November 3rd, the army of invasion camped upon
the eastern fork of the Wabash River, upon a narrow
hillock, where the troops were somewhat crowded
together, with the artillery and cavalrymen in the
centre. Around them was boggy, swampy ground,
while all about the wintry woods in frozen silence gave
no warning of the savage foe, lurking beneath the underbrush
in vindictive anger.</p>

<p>The militiamen were marched well to the front,
nearly a quarter of a mile beyond the rest of the troops,
and there went into camp, while several bands of savages
seen in the gloomy woods made them fully aware that
they were in touch with the foe.</p>

<p>At sunrise, next morning, the soldiers were up and
doing, and, as they were dismissed from parade, St.
Clair sent orders that some entrenchments should be
thrown up before they marched against the Miami
towns, which he knew to be not far distant. Just as
these orders reached the commander of this advance
guard, a blood-curdling yell sounded from the woodland
in front. Another and another followed, and then a
volley of musketry flashed from the dense underbrush.
A second volley followed the first, the militiamen could
see no foe, while many of their comrades were soon
writhing upon the ground in mortal agony. Some
endeavored to fight, but the majority, terrified by the
sudden and unexpected onslaught, turned and rushed
in a wild panic back to the camp of the regulars. In
vain the officers tried to stop the retreat; the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
dashed past them like cowards, and precipitating themselves
among the regular troops, spread dismay and
confusion among them. The veterans sprang to arms,
while the drums rolled the call to quarters. As the
painted braves came bounding through the underbrush,
they were met with a crashing volley from the old campaigners,
which halted their mad career. They stopped,
crouched down behind the brush and fallen timber, and
soon surrounded the camp on all sides. The pickets
were either killed or driven in upon the centre; while
wild yells, cries of defiance, and savage catcalls issued
from the followers of Little Turtle.</p>

<p>But now the battle was on in earnest, and the Indians
ceased their cries to creep from log to log, from tree to
tree, and closer to the American line. The deep boom
of the cannon reverberated through the forest, as the
regulars turned their pieces against the foe. The soldiers
foolishly stood in close order, and, as they were in the
open, they were a shining mark for the balls of the
Indians. Men fell dead and wounded upon every side;
the lines began to waver and break, while St. Clair and
Butler walked behind their men, urging them to be cool,
and to hold their own without flinching. St. Clair's
blanket, coat and leggins were pierced by eight bullets;
a lock of his gray hair was clipped off by a ball; yet he
came through the battle unscathed. Butler had less
good fortune. His arm was broken by a leaden missile;
another struck him in the side, so that he had to be
carried to the centre of the line. Here, propped up upon
knapsacks, he directed the fighting with grim good
humor until, in one of the Indian charges, a painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
warrior broke through the American line and buried his
tomahawk in his brain.</p>

<p>The cannon kept up their fire, but the savages turned
their unerring rifles upon the gunners, and soon had
killed nearly every one of them. When they saw the
men lying upon the ground, they took courage, and
with a wild yelping made a charge from the woodland
in the endeavor to capture the pieces. But now the
Americans could see the skulking foe, and with bayonets
fixed, made a dash into the oncoming horde of painted
braves. The Indians did not wait to receive the blow,
but, turning about, scurried helter-skelter to the protection
of the forest, into which the victorious rangers
ran in great enthusiasm. This was shortlived, for the
redskins quickly surrounded them in the rear, poured
in a galling fire from behind the protection of stumps
and logs, and, before they could get back to their own
line, had killed one-half of those who had charged them.
One detachment rushed across the Wabash in pursuit of
the Indians, and, before the men returned to the American
line, nearly all had been slaughtered. The dead
were lying about in heaps; the tomahawks of the Indians
dispatched every man who was breathing; while, as
one of the packers has written in his memoirs, "the
bleeding heads of the scalped artillerymen and rangers
looked like pumpkins in a December cornfield on the
farm in Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>The fight had now lasted all day, and the American
army had begun to realize that it was impossible to defeat
the bloodthirsty followers of Little Turtle, who,
emboldened by the disorganization in the ranks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
white men, now pushed in upon them from every
quarter. It was five o'clock in the evening when the
ranks began to give away. The camp and artillery
were abandoned. Most of the militia threw away their
arms and accoutrements. St. Clair in vain endeavored
to stem the torrent of the rout. Horses, soldiers, and
the few camp followers and women who had accompanied
the army were all mixed together in a confusion
of panic-stricken uselessness. But out of the
rabble St. Clair managed to get enough men together
to charge the savages, who held the roadway in the rear,
to push them aside, and make room for the torrent of
fugitives who now ran for their lives towards Fort
Jefferson. The troops pressed on like a drove of bullocks.
They stampeded; they fled ignominiously; while
in their rear the wild wail of jubilation from the victorious
red men sounded harshly from the dark background
of the frozen forest. St. Clair, like Braddock,
had been overwhelmingly repulsed.</p>

<p>From the moment of retreat until sunset the yelping
redskins followed the panic-stricken Americans. Thirty-eight
officers and five hundred and ninety-three men
were slain or missing, while twenty-one officers and two
hundred and forty-two men were wounded, many of
whom died soon afterwards, so that practically two-thirds
of the entire force of fourteen hundred were either
lost or disabled. What a terrible defeat! What a
humiliating blow! And all through the sagacity and
ability of Little Turtle, Chief of the Miamis, the man
with a red skin who organized and led an Indian army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>in a manner equal to the best of white leaders. Fortunate,
indeed, was it that the Indians stopped to plunder
the camp of the Americans, for, had they kept on, it
is probable that only a few stragglers would have lived
to tell the tale of the awful butchery. "Five hundred
skull bones lay in the space of three hundred and fifty
yards," said an American general, who visited the
battle ground not many months after the defeat. "From
thence, five miles on, the woods were strewn with
skeletons, muskets, broken wagons, knapsacks and other
debris." The loss to Little Turtle's men has never been
ascertained, but it is certain that his dead and missing
were not proportionate to those of St. Clair.</p>

<p>At Fort Jefferson the most severely wounded were
left, while the rest of the troops, in fear and utter disorganization,
hurried forward to Fort Washington and
the log huts of Cincinnati. Here they huddled in security,
cursing their ill fortune, their losses, and the
Indians. An American officer who ran into a party of
thirty braves near the battle ground a day or two after
the defeat (and who was held by them until he persuaded
them that he was an Englishman from Canada),
was told that the troops under Little Turtle numbered
but fifteen hundred, and that the number of killed was
fifty-six. One of these warriors dangled one hundred
and twenty-seven American scalps on a pole before his
eyes, while they had three pack horses laden with as
much wine and kegs of brandy as could be strapped
to their backs. The savages were all much emboldened
by their great victory, and numerous raids upon the
border showed that they were more unfriendly to the
whites than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>It was six weeks before the Federal authorities and
General Washington knew of this catastrophe. Denny,
a young Lieutenant, carried word of the defeat by horse
to Philadelphia, where was then the seat of Federal
Government. Washington was at dinner with company
when the news of the disaster reached him, and, with an
apology to his guests, left the table to receive it. He
shortly returned and resumed his chair without any
allusion to the incident. At ten o'clock the guests departed
and left the President alone with his secretary,
Mr. Lear. The General walked slowly backward and
forward for a considerable length of time in silence; then
taking a seat on the sofa near the fire, he told Mr. Lear
to sit down. The latter had not noticed that the great
man was extremely agitated, when he suddenly broke out
with: "It's all over! St. Clair is defeated! routed,
the officers nearly all killed, the men by wholesale, the
rout complete, too shocking to think of, and a surprise
into the bargain!" He made these remarks with great
vehemence; then pausing and rising from the sofa, he
walked up and down the room in silence, violently
agitated, but saying nothing. When near the door
he stopped short, stood still for a few moments, and
then again exploded with wrath:</p>

<p>"Yes," he thundered. "<i>Here</i>, on this very spot, I
took leave of him; I wished him success and honor.
'You have your instructions from the Secretary of
War,' said I, 'I had a strict eye to them, and will add but
one word, <i>Beware of a Surprise!</i> You know how the
Indians fight us. I repeat it, <i>Beware of a Surprise!</i>' He
went off with that, my last warning, thrown into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
ears. And yet! To suffer that army to be cut to pieces,
hacked, butchered, tomahawked by a surprise, the
very thing I guarded him against. O God! O God!"
exclaimed the agitated President, throwing up his hands,
while his very frame shook with emotion. "He's worse
than a murderer! How can he answer to his country?
The blood of the slain is upon him, the curse of widows
and orphans, the curse of heaven!"</p>

<p>Mr. Lear remained speechless; awed into breathless
silence by the appalling tone in which the torrent of
invective was poured forth. The paroxysm passed by,
and Washington sank down upon the sofa, silent, with
bowed head, as if conscious of the ungovernable burst
of passion which had overcome him. "This must not
go beyond this room," said he, at length, in a subdued
and altered tone. Then in a quiet, low voice he added:
"General St. Clair shall have justice. I looked hastily
through the dispatches; saw the whole disaster; but
not all the particulars. I will receive him with displeasure;
I will hear him without prejudice; he shall
have full justice!"</p>

<p>Thus, in due time, St. Clair presented himself before
Washington, and, although fearful of the reception
which he would receive, he was earnestly and respectfully
listened to by the President. The overwhelming
nature of his defeat had been due to his incompetence,
to his inability to teach the raw troops how to fight,
Indian-fashion, before he began his march against the
followers of Little Turtle, and to his failure to send out
proper scouts.</p>

<p>Although deeply chagrined by the defeat, Congress did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
not sit idle, and soon made preparations for another
army of Indian fighters. The chief command this time
was intrusted to "Mad Anthony" Wayne, the hero of
Stony Point, and a man to whom the smell of burning
powder was as champagne. He not only loved a good
fight, but he knew how to handle men, how to gain
their confidence, and how to whip raw levies into excellent
fighting material. He accepted the command
only on condition that he be given plenty of time to
drill and equip his troops. The Indians, themselves,
appreciated his worth. He was called "The Black
Snake" by them, because he was supposed to possess
the superior cunning of this reptile, and to be able to
creep through the forest like the moccasin. His choice
to the chief command of the army was soon to be justified
by results. Yet two years elapsed from the time
of St. Clair's dreadful defeat before Wayne attempted
to press through the wilderness into the land of the
Miamis.</p>

<p>During these two years numerous petty forays were
made by the Indians against the border settlements.
Little Turtle was in some of these, and in November,
1792, made a violent attack upon a detachment of Kentucky
volunteers near Fort St. Clair on the frontier. A
stubborn battle was waged all day, at the end of which,
Major Marshall (who commanded the American rangers)
was driven pellmell into the fort (about half a mile)
with the loss of six killed, the camp equipage taken, and
one hundred and forty pack horses secured by the
Miami and Shawnee braves. The Indians lost but two
men. Again in June, 1794, this now much-dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Little Turtle was in an attack upon Fort Recovery, in
which he exhibited masterful strategy, and in which
a large detachment of American rangers, under Major
McMahon, was cut to pieces and stampeded. Repeated
efforts were made by the American Government to secure
a treaty of peace with the Miami warrior, but to all
overtures he turned a deaf ear. "We will hold our own
country for our own people," said he. "Indian land
is for the Indian. The white man must go away."</p>

<p>But the white man, as usual, would not go away.
Instead, he came on with renewed courage, resources,
and determination. Little Turtle warned his warriors
that they must prepare for another struggle, and counselled
them to practice evolutions and warfare. They
paid little attention to these commands. "There are
more long knives under the Great Snake than have
ever come against us before," said he. "They are led
by the best general of all the palefaces. Would it not
be well if we made a treaty of peace and lived in friendly
relations to these invaders?"</p>

<p>"No, no," shouted his hearers. "We will fight!
Lead us again into battle, let your heart not shrink at
the numbers of the long knives. We can defeat them!
We will leave them for the wolves to feast on, even as
we left the men of St. Clair's army. We will fight!"
So the far-seeing chieftain of the Miamis had to again
lead his supposedly invincible warriors against the foe.</p>

<p>When the bleaching skeletons of St. Clair's men had
been buried in the dense forest, Wayne erected the fort,
called Fort Recovery, and then, pressing onward through
the Indian country, he built another big fortress, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Fort Defiance, at the confluence of the Au-Glaize and
Miami rivers. He had two thousand regulars and
eleven hundred Kentucky horsemen with him, the latter
being well used to border warfare, and excellent woodsmen.
Then, the soldiers all liked the Commander-in-Chief
and had full confidence in his ability, which gave
them an esprit de corps, without which no army can
accomplish anything. Wayne, himself, was at the
furthermost post when the attack was made upon Fort
Recovery by the savages, under Little Turtle, and three
weeks after this he pressed forward against the Miami
towns. Determined to avoid the fate of Braddock and
St. Clair, he kept his force always in open order and
ready for the fray, while scouts hovered continually on
his flanks and front. Every night breastworks of fallen
trees were thrown up around his camps so that the
savages could not "rush" the soldiers. "The paleface
takes his army twice as far in a day as did St. Clair,"
said the Indian scouts who watched his advance. "He
has men out on every side and it will be impossible to
ambush him. We must fight and fight hard against
this Big Serpent, for he means to win." Small parties
of friendly Chickasaw or Choctaw Indians threaded the
forest miles in advance of the marching army. White
Indian fighters assisted them in watching the Miami
and other hostiles, and thus, like a huge wolf of the
woods, the army of "Mad Anthony" Wayne crept
silently, stealthily, and ominously towards the villages
of the unfriendly redskins.</p>

<p>Wayne had sent an offer of peace to the followers of
Little Turtle from Fort Defiance, and had summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
them to dispatch deputies to meet him. The letter was
carried by Christopher Miller and a Shawnee prisoner,
and in it the American general said: "Miller is a
Shawnee by adoption whom my soldiers captured six
months ago, and the Shawnee warrior was taken two
days ago. I have taken several Indians prisoner and
they have been treated well. They will be put to death
if Miller is harmed." When, therefore, these envoys
arrived at the camp of Little Turtle, the Indians were
afraid to kill them, but they endeavored to delay their
answer and would not send back a reply. So the now
determined "Mad Anthony" advanced against them
immediately and laid waste the cornfields which the
Miamis had planted, and which lay in the route of his
troops.</p>

<p>Soon the ever-ready frontiersmen burst through the
woodland near the Maumee rapids, only a few miles
below a British fort, called Fort Maumee, well garrisoned
and well supplied. A rough breastwork was constructed
to protect the American stores and baggage,
and scouts were sent forward to view the position of the
followers of Little Turtle. Between fifteen hundred
and two thousand warriors with seventy rangers from
Detroit, composed of French, English and refugee
Americans, were in force near the walls of the English
stockade. The Indians were Shawnees, Wyandots,
Ottawas, Miamis, Pottawattamies, Chippewas and Iroquois.
They lay in a place called Fallen Timbers, because
the wind had here blown down the trees of the
forest and had piled them up in dense rows. It was
an excellent place for defense, and Little Turtle had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
shown his sagacity in selecting it. With confidence
the painted warriors waited for the attack, as they knew
that their position was a good one, and despised the
Americans, whom they had so signally routed under St.
Clair. Their line was about two miles in length and
all were well armed.</p>

<p>As General Wayne scanned the Indian position, he
quickly made up his mind how to attack it. "The
dragoons will advance upon the right flank," he directed.
"The regular cavalry will move up on the left flank near
the river. The infantry will form in two lines in the
centre, and will first fire, and then charge the red vermin
with the bayonet. The mounted volunteers will move
over far to the left and will turn the right flank of the
savages. As soon as all are ready, attack and wipe out
St. Clair's ignominious rout!" The subordinate officers
received his orders with enthusiasm and when all were
prepared, in extended order, the whole line moved out
for the fray.</p>

<p>In the centre of Wayne's troops was a small force
of mounted volunteers&mdash;Kentucky militiamen&mdash;and
they were well in advance of the two lines of infantrymen.
With a wild yell, a mass of savages jumped up
from the protection of the fallen trees, rushed upon the
oncoming riflemen, and soon drove them back into the
advancing infantry. But this success was not lasting.
A volley of well-aimed bullets checked their howling advance,
and, with a dogged persistence, the rangers crept
on upon the savages, reserving their fire by strict orders
from their beloved "Mad Anthony." As they came
forward, the Indians leaped up to deliver their fire, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
when they did so, the Americans poured a galling volley
into their ranks, then, fixing bayonets, rushed precipitously
upon them before they had time to load.
As they charged, the cavalrymen, with hoarse cheers,
galloped their rawboned steeds into the left flank of the
Indian line. Their horses jumped across the fallen logs,
and in an instant they were in the midst of the naked
braves, slashing to the right and left with their keen
swords, and cutting down all who stood in their way.</p>

<p>"Hah!" exclaimed General Wayne, rubbing his hands.
"They give! They fall back! They run! The day is
ours!" As he spoke a galloping aide came panting to
his side. "Captain Campbell is killed," said he, "and
Captain Van Rensselaer is down, but Lieutenant Covington
is leading the dragoons, and they are driving the
redskins before them like a crowd of sheep."</p>

<p>He spoke only too truthfully, for unable to stand up
against the slashing charge, the red men broke and fled
before the enthusiastic troopers of "Mad Anthony"
Wayne. When the painted and half-naked braves attempted
to make a stand, they were knocked down with
ease. The second line of infantrymen did not cross the
fallen timber in time to get a shot at the disappearing
warriors of Little Turtle. On the left flank, the horse-riflemen
had nothing to charge when they galloped into
the thickets, for the unvaliant red warriors had vanished.
About a hundred braves lay dead and dying upon the
field. Mixed in among them were a few of the white
renegades who had joined them. The action had lasted
but forty minutes, and the defeats of Harmar and St.
Clair had been forever vindicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>For two miles the now excited Americans rushed after
the vaunted warriors of the frontier, who had adopted
the ancient motto: "He who fights and runs away
will live to fight another day." The fugitives dashed
up to the walls of the British fort and implored admittance,
but the garrison greeted their request with curses,
and bolted the doorway in their faces. So they were
forced to rush off into the dense woodland. "Burn
everything up to the walls of the fort," commanded
General Wayne. "Cut down the crops of the Indians,
destroy their villages, level the houses of the British
agents and traders to the sod. I want to give this
Little Turtle and his men a lesson which they will never
cease to remember!" The British commander in Fort
Maumee vigorously protested against this, but Wayne
summoned him to abandon his stockades, which he, of
course, refused, and, not daring to interfere, saw the
homes of his Indian allies soon blazing and covered with
a pall of thick, black vapor. The work of destruction
was quickly over, and the victorious American army
was on its way back to Fort Defiance.</p>

<p>The troops went into winter quarters at Greenville,
while the Indians were severely disheartened by their
defeat. Their anger was intense against the British,
for these people had goaded them on to war, had given
them material aid, and, as soon as the fortune of battle
went against them, had abandoned them to their fate.
Starvation and hunger were rampant, as their homes,
crop and stores of provisions had been completely destroyed.
Their cattle, and even their dogs, had died,
and, as the British in Fort Maumee would give them no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
food, they sent envoy after envoy to the Americans to
exchange prisoners, and to promise that, in the spring,
they would make peace. All the leaders now recognized
that it was time to make terms with Wayne, and many
now appreciated that they should have listened to the
counsel of Little Turtle, before the exasperating defeat
at the Fallen Timbers. On February 11th, the Shawnees,
Delawares and Miamis entered into a preliminary
treaty with General Wayne, and in the summer of 1795
made a definite peace at Greenville. "Elder Brother,"
said a Chippewa chief, "you asked me who were the
true owners of the land now ceded to the United States.
In answer I tell you, if any nations should call themselves
the owners of it they would be guilty of falsehood;
our claim to it is equal; our Elder Brother had conquered
it."</p>

<p>Thus another step westward was made by the whites,
and another war had added thousands of square miles of
territory to the people of the United States. The
survival of the most fit was evident, for, had the red men
possessed the same mental characteristics which the
whites possessed, they would have beaten not two
armies, but three armies. This small difference of
ability had made them the submitting nation, while the
powerful Anglo-Saxons now pushed their civilization
into the unbroken forest, soon killed off all the game,
built smoky cities, railroads, and steamboats; cut down
all the timber, grew corn, oats and potatoes, and utilized
the resources of the soil to its utmost capacity.</p>

<p>Little Turtle settled on Eel River about twenty miles
from Fort Wayne, where the American troops built him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
a comfortable house. He made frequent visits to
Philadelphia and Washington, and was made much of
by the agents, who appreciated his worth. But this
destroyed, for a time, at least, his influence among the
people of his own color, who suspected his honesty and
envied his good fortune. He, therefore, often opposed
the desires of the United States Government in order
to regain his popularity with his red brethren. No
prisoner had ever been tortured by his warriors, as he
opposed this brutal practice. Nor would he allow
captives to be burned at the stake. With energy he
devoted himself to the spread of temperance among
the members of his own tribe, for he saw the awful results
which bad whiskey had upon the once warlike
braves. "These white traders strip the poor Indians of
skins, gun, blanket, everything, while his squaw and the
children dependent upon him be starving in his wigwam,"
said he. "My people barter away their best
treasures for the white man's miserable firewater."</p>

<p>Greatly respected and deeply interested in the problems
among his own people, Little Turtle spent his
declining years. When asked one day why he did not
live in Philadelphia instead of in his cabin on the Wabash,
he replied: "I admit that you whites live better than
do we red men, but I could not live with you because
I am as a deaf and dumb man. I cannot talk your
language. When I walk through the city streets I see
every person in his shop employed at something. One
makes shoes, another makes hats, a third sells cloth, and
everyone lives by his labor. I say to myself, 'Which
of these things can you do?' Not one. I can make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
bow or an arrow, catch fish, kill game, and go to war,
but none of these are any good here. To learn what is
done in Philadelphia would require a long time. Old
age is coming on me; I should be a piece of furniture
among the whites, useless to them, useless to myself.
I must return to my own country."</p>

<p>What he said of old age coming on was only too true.
Not long afterwards he came to his death on the turf of
the open camp, and with the composure which characterizes
his race. He was buried at Fort Wayne with all the
honors of war, and, it is said, was about seventy years
of age at the time of his departure to the Happy Hunting
Grounds: those fields of elysian bliss of which the old
Indian poets have told in song and story. Courageous,
kind, far-seeing, eloquent, well-balanced, the memory
of Little Turtle yet stirs the hearts of his few descendants,
who look back upon his career with satisfaction
and high regard.</p>

<h2>TECUMSEH, "THE SHOOTING STAR": CELEBRATED SHAWANOE DIPLOMAT, ORATOR AND SOLDIER</h2>


<p>When Little Turtle and his army were battling
with "Mad Anthony" Wayne at Fallen
Timbers, one warrior&mdash;a Shawanoe&mdash;was present,
who was subsequently to play an important part
in the struggle between the whites and redskins for
the possession of America. This was Tecumseh, or
"The Shooting Star," a Shawanoe, or Shawnee warrior
who was born on the Mad River in Ohio, in 1768, and
whose father was killed in the fierce battle of the Great
Kanawha. His twin brother, Elsk-wata-wa, the Prophet,
was to become a man of note among the Western
Indians, just as he was, himself, to obtain fame and
notoriety.</p>

<p>The people of the tribe to which this celebrated
man belonged were noted for "much talk" as well as
for hard fighting, and Tecumseh was never at a loss
for words. His appearance was always noble, his form
symmetrical, his carriage erect and lofty, his motions
commanding, and, under the excitement of his favorite
theme of driving the American invaders from the lands
of the Indians, he became a new being. When speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
upon the subject, his countenance would light up with
fiery and haughty pride; his frame would swell with
emotion; every posture which he assumed, and every
gesture, would be eloquent with meaning. At the same
time, his language would flow with glowing eloquence,
as it spoke the passionate thoughts of his very soul.
His manner, too, was never coarse, nor was there any
show of cruelty in his disposition. He was a man of
mark among the many Indians who opposed the advance
of the whites into the country watered by the
slow-moving Ohio.</p>

<p>When the treaty of Greenville was signed, this
eminent redskin was about twenty-five years of age,
and, secluding himself in the forests of his own country,
he there lived the existence of a hunter and trapper.
There is no evidence that he was in the numerous
Indian forays which took place upon the frontier at this
time. In fact, various stories have come down to us
that exhibit his friendliness to the whites whom he met
in the forest. A band of roving Shawnees often hunted
with him, and, because of his ability to sway their
spirits with his words and because of his prowess in
hunting, he was elected chief of this small body of
woodland rovers.</p>

<p>One day a number of Shawnees wagered Tecumseh
that each of them could kill as many deer in three
days of hunting as he, himself, could. "I accept your
challenge," said the great chief, "and I will return here
within the period with twice as many deer as any of
you." So making the proper preparations that evening,
he departed next morn at daybreak into the forest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Three days elapsed before any of the huntsmen came
back, but at dusk of the third day since their departure
all returned with their shoulders burdened
with the game which had fallen by their skill. "Ugh!
Ugh!" said one, "I have killed twelve. I have good
my boast!" "And I thirteen," cried another. But,
as he spoke, Tecumseh came into the light of the fire,
staggering beneath a load of peltries. "Here are thirty
deerskins," said he, depositing his bundle before the
other hunters. "The carcasses are in the woods and
I will go to get the haunches tomorrow."</p>

<p>Shortly after this the Shawnee chief entered the
cabin of a white pioneer upon the frontier. This
borderer was friendly to him and would often hunt with
him in the dark recesses of the forest. So Tecumseh
stalked in without introduction, and, with much gravity,
seated himself in a rough hewn chair. A fat Kentuckian
was sitting in the cabin. When he saw the
noted warrior, he began to shake and tremble with fear,
a fact which seemed to amuse the celebrated Indian.
With a meaning glance at the owner of the cabin, Tecumseh
remarked: "I have just returned from a night
hunt against the palefaces. Thirty scalps hang in my
wigwam, which I have secured in this expedition.
But I am looking for just one more." Here he laid his
hand upon his tomahawk. "And I must have this
scalp before the setting of the sun," he thundered.</p>

<p>The Kentuckian was now ghastly pale and was
trembling with fear. This seemed to please the famous
Shawnee, and, walking over to him, he placed his hand
upon his broad and shaking shoulder. "You are scared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
are you not?" said he. "But there is no reason for it.
Ugh! Ugh! I am just playing with you. I would not
hurt a hair upon your head." As he spoke, his host
burst into a hearty laugh, which showed the frightened
borderer that an Indian could joke as well as a white
man.</p>

<p>During this period there is no doubt that Tecumseh
brooded over the fancied wrongs to the members of
his own race and meditated upon some method of
keeping the white settlers away from the lands of his
forefathers. His brother, Elsk-wata-wa, assumed the
name and functions of a prophet and reformer among
the red men, established headquarters at Greenville,
and told them that he had received a divine inspiration
to go among them and save them from extinction.
Calling himself Tensk-wata-wa, or "The Open Door,"
he asserted that the Great Spirit had selected him as a
means of deliverance to his people. Tecumseh approved
of this&mdash;his brother's course&mdash;and did all within
his power to aid him in knitting together the savages
into a well-organized clan. A large band of the Shawnees,
Wyandots, Pottawattamies, Ottawas, Chippewas,
and Kickapoos soon gathered around the Prophet,
who told them that the Great Spirit, who had made the
red men, was not the same as he who had produced
the white men, and that all the misfortunes among their
race were due to the fact that they had tried to imitate
the manners of the whites. He counselled them to
form a great Confederation, to live righteous lives, and
to prepare themselves by drill and practice in shooting,
so that, when the time came, they could show a bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
front to the Americans. The Indians were seized with
a great religious fever, and, burning with anger at the
wrongs which they considered that the whites had heaped
upon their race, were soon in a condition of mind which
needed very little to flame into the passion of war.</p>

<p>The Commissioner from the United States to the
Ohio country, and the Governor of this territory, was
General Harrison, a man of cool judgment and excellent
military genius. His headquarters were at Fort
Wayne, in the present state of Indiana, although he
had a frontier post at Vincennes. His border troops
were not equal in numbers to the great body of redskins
in the surrounding country, but they were well armed,
well equipped, and ready for any emergency. In 1809
this able American General concluded a treaty between
the Delawares, Miamis and Pottawattamies at Fort
Wayne, in which the Indians ceded to the United States
Government a tract of land extending for sixty miles
along the Wabash River, above Vincennes. The
treaty was made during the absence of Tecumseh upon
a visit to a neighboring tribe, and without either his
advice or knowledge. None of his followers, or those
of the Prophet, were present during the transaction.
For this reason, and because he considered that the
Indians had given up too much of their land, Tecumseh
was furiously angry, and threatened to kill the chiefs
who had signed the treaty, saying: "The Americans
can never survey this land, for I shall kill them if they
attempt to do it. It is wrong to give away all of our
possessions, and, if our people continue to do so, there
will be nothing left for the red men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>This was fierce talk, but for many months Tecumseh
had endeavored to form a great confederation of the
Western tribes, similar to that of Pontiac. The Western
Indians had been enemies for centuries, so that it was
a herculean task to bring them together in bonds of
friendship. Yet the astute Tecumseh visited the
Creeks in the far South, and secured the friendship of
Weatherford, or Red Eagle; the tribes living upon the
farthest extremity of Lake Superior; and those who
camped far beyond the muddy waters of the Mississippi.
For four years he pushed through the wilderness, sometimes
in a canoe, and sometimes on foot, making his
camp among the roving bands of redskins, or alone in
the solitude of the forest. Everywhere he would hold
conferences and long pow-wows with the chiefs of the
Western tribes and would warn them that, unless they
joined with him and his brother&mdash;the Prophet&mdash;in a
mighty confederacy, the whites would soon come from
the East in overwhelming numbers, and would completely
cover the land then held by the red men. "You
must make a stand, or your children will be without
hunting grounds," he would say. "Rise, O red men,
rise to defend your homes from invasion by the whites!"
These appeals were not in vain; the redskins prepared
for hostilities under his leadership; and in 1810 it was
said that he controlled more than sixteen hundred
warriors, who were fully prepared for a long campaign.</p>

<p>This activity of Tecumseh and the Prophet gave
Governor Harrison serious alarm, and he wrote of his
fears to the Government at Washington, requesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
more men and more arms upon the frontier. He even
called Tecumseh before him, and said:</p>

<p>"Why are you trying to bring about a union of the
different Indian tribes?"</p>

<p>The great chief looked keenly at him.</p>

<p>"For the same reason that you have brought about
a union of your colonies," he answered. "We Indians
have never objected to that, and what business is it of
yours what we do among ourselves? Besides, you have
so many cheats and scoundrels among you that we must
unite in order to save ourselves from their clutches.
What harm is there in this, pray? We are in our own
country, which has been left us by the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>It is not known what reply the Governor made to
this, but it is known that Tecumseh withdrew to Prophet's
Town, a settlement which he and his brother had
made on the Tippecanoe River (one of the tributaries
of the Wabash) in Indiana. Here was a large body of
Indians who were combining practices of warfare with
their religious exercises, and were often insolent to the
whites. After numerous complaints had reached him
about the redskins who had settled at Prophet's Town,
Governor Harrison sent a messenger to them, asking why
they had established themselves here, and why they
made such active preparations for war.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit has fixed this spot for the Indian
to kindle his campfire, and he dare not go to any other,"
said Tecumseh. "Elsk-wata-wa and his brother Tecumseh
must remain upon the banks of the Tippecanoe,
or the Great Spirit will be angry with them. Evil
birds have carried false news to my father, the Governor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Let him not believe that Elsk-wata-wa, the Prophet,
wishes to make war upon him and his people. It is not
true."</p>

<p>The messenger brought this answer back to Harrison,
but in a few weeks the Governor dispatched a Mr.
Barron to Tippecanoe, with a letter requesting the
Indians to allow the land to be surveyed, to live at peace
with the white settlers, and to submit to the Government.
When Barron reached Tippecanoe, he was conducted
with great ceremony to the place where the
Prophet was seated, surrounded by numerous braves
in their gaudiest raiment.</p>

<p>In a tone of great anger and scorn, the red leader
rose, and said: "For what purpose do you come here?
Bronilette was here; he was a spy. Dubois was here; <i>he</i>
was a spy. Now <i>you</i> have come here; <i>you</i>, also, are a
spy. <i>There</i> is your grave! Look on it!" He pointed,
as he ceased speaking, to the ground near the spot
where the emissary stood, and this person naturally began
to tremble for his life.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the majestic Tecumseh strode from
a lodge, and, in a cold and haughty tone, said: "Your
life is in no danger. Say why you have come among us."</p>

<p>"Here is a letter from Governor Harrison," Barron
replied. "I will read it: 'Tecumseh and Elsk-wata-wa,
I know that your warriors are brave, but ours are not
less so. What can your few brave warriors do against
the innumerable warriors of the Seventeen Fires
(Seventeen States)? Our bluecoats are more numerous
than you can count; our hunters are like leaves in the
forest, or the grains of sand upon the Wabash. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
think that the redcoats (British) can protect you; they
are not even able to protect themselves. They do not
think of going to war with us. If they did, you would
soon see our flag wave over all the forts of Canada.
What reason have you to complain of the Seventeen
Fires? Have they taken anything from you? Have
they ever violated any of the treaties made with the red
men? You say that they have purchased lands from
those who had no right to sell them. Show that this is
so and the land will be instantly restored. Show us
the rightful owners. I have full power to arrange this
business, but, if you would rather carry your complaints
before your great father in Washington, you can do so.'"</p>

<p>"I like this letter," said Tecumseh, when Barron had
finished. "I remember your Big Chief Harrison when
he was with the Big Snake (General Wayne) at Fallen
Timbers. I will come and hold a council with him,
with thirty of my principal men. Some of my young
men will wish to go, too, so there will be more of us.
We will come to the home of your Big Chief in a short
time."</p>

<p>So on the twelfth of August, 1810, four hundred
warriors, painted red, yellow and blue, armed with
tomahawks and spears, and naked to the waist, paddled
down the Wabash to confer with Harrison. They
were a fierce-looking lot, and Tecumseh, who led them,
although not much painted, was brilliant in new clothes
and gorgeous blankets.</p>

<p>Harrison learned of the approach of the Indians from
a scout, and was waiting for them upon the front porch
of his own house, surrounded by a small guard of soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
many citizens of Vincennes, and several civil and military
officers. The redskins were soon seen coming
down the river, and, landing upon the shore, they approached
the house. Advancing to within about forty
yards of the place where Harrison was sitting, they all
halted, and, after an interpreter was sent forward,
Tecumseh stated that he refused to hold the council
upon the porch, but would do so in a grove near by.
The Governor was perfectly willing to acquiesce, and,
moving the chairs and benches to the grove, the whites
seated themselves, while the redskins squatted upon
the grass.</p>

<p>Tecumseh now began to speak. "I am determined
to fight against the cession of lands held by the Indians
to you whites, unless all the tribes assent to it," said
he, in part. "I admit that I attempted to kill the
chief who signed the Fort Wayne treaty, and, therefore,
I will have my own war chiefs, in future, manage the
affairs of our people, and not the village chiefs. You
Americans have driven the Indians from the seacoast
to where we now stand, and you will soon drive us into
the lakes. I will not make war upon your bluecoats,
but, if you push further into our country, I cannot hold
back my followers from the slaughter of your people."
He then made a summary of the wrongs which his
red followers had suffered at the hands of the whites,
and, as he spoke, his warriors nodded their heads in approval,
saying: "Ugh! Ugh! It is the truth!"</p>

<p>When the great Indian leader had finished his oration,
he turned to seat himself, but no chair was there, and
his face showed annoyance at this seeming discourtesy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Appreciating the expression upon his countenance,
Governor Harrison immediately ordered a chair to be
brought him, and, as the interpreter handed it to the
celebrated warrior, he remarked: "Your father requests
you to be seated."</p>

<p>Fire flashed from the beady eyes of Tecumseh, as he
exclaimed in a loud tone:</p>

<p>"My father, eh? The sun is my father, and the earth
is my mother. On her bosom I will repose," and, drawing
his brilliant blanket around him, with great dignity,
he seated himself among his warriors upon the ground.</p>

<p>Not at all disturbed by this tart reply, Harrison
continued: "You Indians are not one nation, and do
not, in common, own this territory. The Miamis have
been the real owners of the tract on the Wabash, which
the United States has secured during the late treaty,
and you Shawnees have no right to interfere with their
actions. Upon the arrival of the whites in this country
they found the Miamis in possession of the land, and
you Shawnees lived in Georgia, from whence you were
driven by the Creeks. It is absurd to say that you
Indians constitute one nation, for if the Great Spirit
had so willed it, he would not have given different
languages to the different tribes."</p>

<p>As the interpreter told this to Tecumseh, his eyes
began to snap angrily. Then, springing to his feet, he
started to gesticulate wildly and to talk in loud, vicious
tones. "What is he saying?" asked the Governor of
the interpreter, but a General who understood the
Shawnee language replied: "These red devils mean
mischief, Governor, be upon your guard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had he ceased speaking than all the painted
warriors grasped their tomahawks, leaped to their feet,
and looked angrily and vindictively at the Governor.
Harrison sprang from his chair, drew his sword, and held
it before him. As he did so, a friendly chief, who stood
near by, pulled out his pistol, and a Captain of the
troops seized a dirk and held it pointed towards the
savages. The citizens who were present and who had
no arms, took up clubs and pieces of the tables and
chairs, while a minister of the Gospel, the Rev. Mr.
Winans, ran to the Governor's house, seized a musket,
and stood at the doorway to defend his family. The
Indians took no move forward, but were all prepared
for an attack, should Tecumseh give the word. They
stood quietly until numerous soldiers ran up and pointed
their loaded muskets at them, and Harrison cried out:
"Cease this demonstration! Put down those guns!"
Then, turning to the interpreter, he continued: "What
is the meaning of this? Ask yonder Indian leader."</p>

<p>"All that you have said is false," cried Tecumseh.
"You and the Seventeen Fires (States) have cheated
and imposed upon the Indians."</p>

<p>"You are a bad man," Harrison replied through the
interpreter. "I will have nothing more to do with you.
Since you have come here for a council, you can go to
your canoes in safety, but you must immediately leave
my village."</p>

<p>When the Indians heard this message, they turned
around sullenly and departed in the direction of their
boats, while the soldiers kept their guns cocked until
they were out of sight. It had been an exciting episode,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
and the citizens breathed a sigh of relief as they saw the
painted warriors disappearing through the woods.
As night fell, Harrison had two companies of militia
brought into the town, and ordered the men to sleep
on their arms, as the Indians would undoubtedly make
an attack. But none came, and all were much surprised
the next day to see a Shawnee runner come into
the streets of the town with a note from Tecumseh,
begging for another interview. "Certain white men
have told me to defy the power of the United States,"
wrote the Shawnee, "and I do not intend to attack
either town or soldiers." Pleased by this pacific message,
Harrison granted another interview, so the crafty
chief of the Shawnees soon put in an appearance, attended
by the same retinue as before. He was now
calm, and conducted himself with courtesy and consideration.</p>

<p>After a lengthy conversation, the Governor said:
"You know, great chief, that the mighty father of the
white men in Washington has decreed that these lands
which we have purchased from the Miamis be surveyed.
Will you oppose our surveyors when we send them
into this country?"</p>

<p>Tecumseh's eye flashed fire, as he replied, through the
interpreter: "Nothing can shake the determination
of myself and my followers to insist upon the old boundary
between your land and ours, before you made this
purchase from the Miamis."</p>

<p>He sat down amidst a chorus of "Hows!" from the
chiefs assembled, and then the leading sachems of the
Wyandots, Pottawatomies, Ottawas and Winnebagos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
arose, and each, in turn, said that he entered in league
with Tecumseh and the Shawnees, and would help them
to repel any advance of the whites beyond the Wabash
River.</p>

<p>"I will make known your decision to the Great
Father in Washington," said Harrison, "and I am certain
that Tecumseh's claim to the land will never be
acknowledged, as the land has been bought by us from
the original owners, the Miamis, who had a perfect
right to sell it." The council now ended.</p>

<p>Next day the Governor visited Tecumseh in his camp,
and was received with great politeness by the great
chief, who was very frank and open in stating his views.
"The Seventeen Fires (United States) will soon drown
all of my people," said he, with great feeling. "If your
great father in Washington will agree to give up the
lands which he has bought from the Miamis; will agree
never to make a treaty for land without the consent of
all of our allied tribes, and will consult with me as the
spokesman of these tribes; I will be your ally in the war
which I know will shortly take place with England.
If you will not do this, I will join with my white brothers
from Canada, who have sent me many messages asking
for my assistance in warfare with your people."</p>

<p>"I will make your views known to the President,"
said Harrison, "but I know that he will not agree with
them."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Tecumseh, "as the great chief is
to settle the matter, I hope the Great Spirit will put
enough sense into his head to cause him to give up
the land. It is true that he is so far off that he will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
be injured by the war. He will sit still in his own town
and drink his wine, while you and I will have to fight
it out."</p>

<p>The Governor looked grave. "You are right," he
said. "We will soon be fighting each other. A good
many will be killed on both sides, and there will be
much suffering. I ask you to agree with me, Tecumseh,
that there will be no capturing of women and children
by your warriors, and no torture or ill treatment of
those men that your warriors take as prisoners."</p>

<p>Tecumseh raised his hand aloft. "I will keep my
people from these things," he exclaimed. "Tecumseh
has never ill treated his prisoners, nor has it ever been
done in his presence." So saying, he sat down, and
Governor Harrison returned to his own troops, much
satisfied with the manner in which he had been received.</p>

<p>As the great chief had said, war was soon to break out
between the whites and redskins, and, seeing the probability
of this, Tecumseh soon left upon a journey to
the South, where he intended to visit the Choctaws,
Creeks, Seminoles, and other tribes, and to ask their
assistance in driving the white men from their territory.
He had marvellous success. The Indians were infatuated
by his persuasive eloquence and promised
their allegiance to him and his cause. At Tuckabatchie,
Alabama, he addressed the Creeks in a big council, but
his remarks were not greeted with the same cordiality
as elsewhere. The Indians, in fact, seemed to have
no interest in the confederation which he begged them
to join, so growing angry, Tecumseh stamped his
foot upon the ground, and, looking at the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Sachem, called Big Warrior, cried: "Your blood is
white. You do not believe that the Great Spirit has
sent me. You shall know that it is so. I leave Tuckabatchie
directly, and shall go straight to Detroit. When
I arrive there I will stamp on the ground with my foot
and will shake down every house in Tuckabatchie."</p>

<p>This was certainly a wild threat, but the crafty
Tecumseh knew what he was talking about, for he had
heard from a white astrologer that an earthquake was
soon to take place. The Creeks often talked over this
threat, after the departure of the great Shawnee, and
carefully reckoned upon the number of days that it
would take him to get to Detroit. In course of time
they estimated that he had arrived there, and, as they
anxiously awaited the fulfillment of the threat, a terrible
rumbling was heard, the earth rocked to and fro, the
tepees and lodges trembled and shook, and suddenly
many of them toppled over. Terrified and alarmed,
the Creeks rushed wildly about, crying: "Tecumseh
has arrived at Detroit. His threat has come true. We
must join with him in his confederation or all will be
lost." This was the historical earthquake of New Madrid
or the Mississippi, which (according to tradition) took
place upon the very day that Tecumseh reached Detroit.
It secured for him a great and lasting reputation
among the red men.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the Indians at Prophet's Town became
very warlike and aggressive, so much so that Governor
Harrison determined to send an armed force against
them. Tecumseh was away, but his brother, Elsk-wata-wa
(the Prophet), was a pretty good warrior, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
was burning in hatred of the whites. He inspired his
followers with many good thoughts; taught them to
give up firewater (whiskey) and also to till the soil.
But he also preached to them that they must kill off
the whites if they could, and so stem their advance into
the land once held by the redskins. On September
26, 1811, at the head of nine hundred troops, Harrison
moved towards the encampment of these hostiles, and,
after marching for six days, camped on the eastern shore
of the Wabash River, two miles above the present city
of Terre Haute. A log fortress of felled trees was here
constructed, called Fort Harrison, and leaving a small
guard here, the main army advanced along the Wabash
River until it reached a broad stream, called the Vermillion.
A blockhouse was erected to protect the
boats and heavy baggage, and then the white troops
pressed forward to a position three-quarters of a mile
away from the Indian encampment at Prophet's Town.
Harrison had moved warily and cautiously, with scouts
out upon either side to warn him of ambuscades. The
two fortifications in his rear were excellent protection
should he be forced to retreat, while his soldiers and
frontiersmen were well used to border warfare, and showed
no such careless advancing as had the men under St.
Clair.</p>

<p>Seven miles northeast of the present city of Lafayette,
Indiana, the army camped upon a beautifully level
stretch of ground, upon which was a belt of timber.
In front lay a marshy prairie, stretching away to
Prophet's Town, while on the right was another marshy
strip, through which ran a small stream surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
by willows and brushwood. It was a good position;
higher than the surrounding country, dryer, and more
healthful. Before the army had reached this place,
the Governor had sent messengers to the Prophet,
demanding that the various tribes which he had with
him should return to their respective territories; that
all stolen horses in their possession should be given up;
and that all Indians who had murdered white settlers
should be delivered over to justice. But these messengers
(all friendly Indians) had nearly all been insulted
and dismissed with contemptuous remarks about themselves
and the Governor. Harrison was, therefore,
eager to fall upon the red men and give them a sound
thrashing&mdash;such a thrashing that they would not soon
forget.</p>

<p>The soldiers reached this position about midday, and
soon ambassadors came in from Prophet's Town with
a request that they refrain from battle until the following
day, when a peace talk could be had. Harrison consented
to this, but was too wary to be caught napping,
and made his men sleep in order of battle, with their
muskets loaded beside them. The night was dark and
rainy. Sentries were, therefore, carefully stationed upon
every side of the American camp, and these were told
to keep a sharp lookout for any approaching savage.
As it was the sixth of November the air was crisp and
chill, while the brown leaves of autumn littered the
ground with a thick covering, which made it difficult
for a foe to approach unobserved. Every officer and
private was told exactly what to do, in case of an attack,
and thus the little army of invasion rested, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
bulldog upon the leash, ready and prepared to make a
spring.</p>

<p>A sentinel, well in advance of the American line, was
looking intently across the wide sweep of prairie in the
direction of Prophet's Town&mdash;shrouded in the murk of
the early morning mist&mdash;when he saw something moving
in the yellow grass. The blades bent to the right and
left as if some animal were creeping through them, so
the watchman became alarmed. Seizing his musket, he
stooped down to peer through the reedy waste, and, as
he did so, a tomahawk, hurled by an unseen hand,
spun through the air and just missed his head. In a
second, his gun was at his shoulder, and he fired at a dark
object which he saw in the reeds before him. A wild
warwhoop shrilled through the stillness, as he did so,
and from all about, in the tall grass, the painted forms
of red men leaped from their hiding places and rushed
towards the sleeping camp. But they met a different
reception than that which they had anticipated. The
men who had been resting on their arms had, in a moment,
seized their muskets, had formed in a line facing
the enemy, and met the onrush of the savages with
a volley of lead.</p>

<p>The attacking force consisted of between five and
eight hundred warriors under White Loon, Stone Eater,
and Winnemac. The Prophet had mixed a mysterious
broth at a meeting of the Indians the night before, and
had told his followers that one-half of Harrison's army
was composed of dead men, and that the other half was
made up of crazy soldiers. Encouraged by this, the
Indians had begun to creep across the prairie in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
direction of the American camp at four in the morning.
The Prophet had also stated that the bullets of the
Americans would rebound from the bodies of the red
men, but this did not prove to be the case, for, as the
mixed bands of warriors came onward, they were shot
down by scores. Still, they attacked with terrible fury,
and, armed with excellent short rifles which had been
furnished them by the Indian traders, they did a great
deal of damage to the American line. Soon the entire
camp was surrounded by the redskins, who rushed
forward with tremendous ferocity, and, where the
soldiers formed hollow squares with their bayonets
outward, the braves would throw themselves vindictively
upon them and endeavor to knock them over
with their tomahawks.</p>

<p>The only coward on the side of the Indians was
the famous Prophet. While his followers were struggling
desperately with the frontiersmen, he stood upon a small
hill, well out of harm's way, and cried out encouragement
to the Indians in a shrill and piercing voice.
"Fight on, O my people," he kept repeating, "for it
shall be as the Prophet has said. You will crush these
white enemies." The sounds of his wailing could easily
be heard by Harrison's men, and, although some of his
warriors requested him to join them in battle, he did
not seem as anxious to appear on the firing line as they
had expected. His followers, on the other hand, fought
most courageously, and threw themselves with desperation
upon the unyielding American line. Harrison
rode up and down among his men, cheering them on, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>crying to them not to give in to the assaults of the redskins,
and, although he usually mounted a white horse,
in the confusion of the morning, he had seized one of
another color. This probably saved his life, as the
Indians knew that his usual mount was white and soon
killed his own animal which a young lieutenant was
riding. The rider also fell, pierced by a dozen well-directed
bullets.</p>

<p>While the yells of the Indians were intermingled with
the hoarse shouts of the rangers, the rattle of deer's
hoofs was heard above the din, and, at this savage
signal, the redskins retreated beyond rifle range. But
they were not yet defeated, and soon formed for another
onslaught, while the white soldiers re-arranged their
own line, fixed bayonets, and reloaded, in anticipation
of a second charge. "Give the redskins a dose of lead,
first," commanded Harrison, "then at 'em with the
bayonets. But keep in touch all along the line, and
do not allow yourselves to get split up into small parties,
which the red devils can surround!" His counsel was
well heeded.</p>

<p>In a few moments the followers of the Prophet again
rushed from the underbrush upon the extended line of
the American rangers, and, although the savages had
now departed from their usual custom of fighting behind
cover, this was to do them no good. As they ran
desperately against the now well-prepared men in buckskin,
they were met with a murderous fire, for day was
well advanced, and the white soldiers could see their
gun sights. The roar from the rifles was continuous.
The redskins fell to earth upon every side. Shrieks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>and groans of the wounded and dying men were intermingled
with the coarse shouts of battle, as the forms
of Indians and whites struggled and fell, locked in a
deadly embrace beneath a cloud of drifting smoke, which
hung above the battle ground.</p>

<p>But now the moment came for an advance of the
buckskin-clad rangers. As at Waterloo when Wellington
cried: "Up guards and at 'em!" Harrison called:
"On, men! Give them the bayonet, and no quarter!"
With a wild yell of enthusiasm the rangers started
forward and ploughed into the masses of the redskins
with a will. With sharp bayonet thrusts they cut down
all who opposed them, for they struck out savagely,
and hacked away like Cromwell's Ironsides. Nothing
could stand up against such an onrush. The Indians
wilted. They gave in. They turned. They ran. And
the first to skip headlong across the yellow prairie was
the far-famed Prophet, whose courage had oozed from
him like water through a sieve. His prophecies had
all gone wrong; his incantations had been worthless,
and his influence among the red men had forever
parted.</p>

<p>Harrison now pressed on to Prophet's Town, and
found it absolutely deserted, for the Indians had decided
to abandon everything, and had left behind their
corn, chickens, hogs, household furniture, and firearms.
As the rangers swept onward, thirty-seven of their own
numbers lay dead upon the famous field of Tippecanoe,
while one hundred and thirty-seven wounded limped
to the carts in their rear. The redskin loss was never
known, but it must have been much larger than that of
the whites. Flushed with victory, the Americans soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
destroyed the Indian village, and then returned to
Vincennes, well satisfied with such a complete victory.
Harrison, himself, had won the admiration of his countrymen;
so much so, that thirty years later he was
elected President of the United States, mainly because
of the fame which he won in this frontier battle. The
campaign slogan of "Tippecanoe (as Harrison was
called) and Tyler, too," swept over the country like
fire, and roused an enthusiasm for the brave leader
which has seldom been equalled. It resulted in his
election to the position of Chief Executive by a magnificent
majority.</p>

<p>Tecumseh had been away at the time of the battle,
and, when he heard of the defeat of his own people, he
was furious with rage. Hastening to Prophet's Town,
he found only ashes and desolation where once had been
stores, ammunition, arms, and houses. Filled with mortification
and anger, he searched for his brother, the
Prophet, and when he found him, shook him by the hair,
so great was his resentment; for he had told the Indians
to fight no battle during his absence. The Prophet
was ever afterwards an object of contempt, and, as he
would walk through the Indian village, the boys would
yell and jeer at him, while the braves would turn their
backs when they saw him coming.</p>

<p>Tecumseh wrote to General Harrison that he now
desired to go to Washington and visit the Great Father,
a request that was granted him. But he was told that
he must go alone, and without a retinue; an answer
which wounded the spirit of the proud savage so deeply
that, when war broke out between the British and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Americans a few years later (the War of 1812), he joined
the English army in Canada, saying: "I have taken
sides with my father, the King, and I will suffer my
bones to bleach upon the shore of the great lakes, before
I will recross the American territory to take part in any
council of neutrality."</p>

<p>In the fighting of the War of 1812 this great chief
showed that he could lead an army almost as well as a
white man. His military talent was so great that he
was made a Brigadier General, a position which, to
my knowledge, no other American Indian has ever
held among white troops, except General Ely S. Parker,
who commanded a detachment of regulars in the Army
of the Potomac during the War of the Rebellion. The
celebrated Shawnee fought bravely at a fierce fight at
Brownstown, and was also at the siege of Detroit, with
about seven hundred warriors, when this city capitulated
to the British. The whole American frontier was
open to the ravages of the Indians and English after
this event, and under General Proctor, the combined
forces of redskins and redcoats swept down upon the
border fortress of Fort Meigs, and here captured a
number of prisoners, although they did not take the
stockade.</p>

<p>The Indians under Tecumseh numbered about
eighteen hundred in the fighting at this place, and,
giving way to their instincts, they tomahawked all that
they could. General Proctor made no attempt to stop
them, but was looking calmly at their fiendish work,
when he saw Tecumseh galloping forward at great speed.
Reaching the scene of slaughter, the savage leaped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
his horse, and seizing two Indians by the throat,
knocked them to the ground. Then, drawing his tomahawk
and scalping knife, he cried out: "He of you who
injures another prisoner will be killed by Tecumseh.
How dare you wreak vengeance upon defenseless men?
Cowards! Begone!" Cowed by his consuming wrath,
the savages slunk away, while the great chief, turning to
Proctor, said: "Why, General, did you not stop this
awful massacre?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the British General, "your Indians
cannot be restrained."</p>

<p>"Begone!" thundered Tecumseh. "You are not fit
to command! Go home and put on the petticoat of a
squaw."</p>

<p>Shortly after this the celebrated Shawnee noticed a
small group of Indians near by, who were standing
about some prisoners. "Yonder are four of your
people who have been taken prisoners," said Colonel
Elliot to him. "You may do as you please with them."
Tecumseh, therefore, walked over to the group and found
four Shawnees, who, while fighting on the side of the
Americans, had been unable to escape the British
regulars, and had been captured. "Friends," said he,
"Colonel Elliot has placed you in my charge, and I
will send you back to your nation to have a talk with
your people." So saying, he took them with him for
some distance, and then sent two of his warriors to accompany
them to their own chiefs, where they were
discharged, under the promise that they would never
fight again against the British during the war.</p>

<p>The disasters to the Americans led the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
to collect a larger army, which was placed under the
command of General Harrison, the hero of Tippecanoe.
Captain Oliver H. Perry built a fleet on Lake Erie,
sailed out to attack the British boats, and defeated them.
When he had done so, Harrison moved upon Fort
Malden, where both Proctor and Tecumseh were stationed.
The former burned the fort and retreated with
Tecumseh's Indians, meaning to join the other British
forces at Niagara, but before the retreat (when Harrison
was at Fort Meigs) Tecumseh had sent him a personal
challenge, which ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">General Harrison</span>: I have with me eight hundred
braves. You have an equal number in your hiding
place. Come out with them and give me battle. You
talked like a brave when we met at Vincennes, and I
respected you, but now you hide behind logs, and in
earth, like a groundhog. Give me answer!</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Tecumseh</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Harrison, however, refused to come out, and, as
Proctor decided to retreat, Tecumseh seriously meditated
a withdrawal from the contest. "You always
told us that you would never draw your foot off British
ground," said he to the English commander. "Now,
father, we see that you are drawing back, and we are
sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the
enemy. We must compare our Father's conduct to a
fat dog which carries its tail on its back, but, when
affrighted, drops it between its legs and runs off. Father,
listen! The Americans have not yet defeated us by
land, neither are we sure that they have done so by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
water; we, therefore, wish to remain here and fight
our enemy, should he make his appearance. If we are
defeated, we will then retreat with our father.</p>

<p>"Father, you have got the arms and ammunition
which our great father sent to his red children. If you
have an idea of going away, give them to us and you
may go, and welcome. For us, our lives are in the hand
of the Great Spirit. We are determined to defend our
land, and if it be his will, we wish to leave our bones
upon them."</p>

<p>But Proctor would listen to no such talk, and
pretended, from time to time, that he would halt and
give battle. Much to the chagrin of the redskins,
he kept on moving. Finally he halted on the river
Thames, in Michigan, near a Moravian town, and told
Tecumseh that he would here fight it out with the
advancing Americans. The great chief, himself, chose
the ground for battling, with a marsh on one flank
and a stream upon the other. "Brother warriors,"
said he to his chiefs, "we are about to enter an engagement
from which I shall, doubtless, never return;
my body will remain upon the field of battle." Then
unbuckling his sword, he handed it to a chief, remarking:
"When my son becomes a noted warrior, and able to
wield a sword, give this to him."</p>

<p>Proctor had planted his guns in the highway and
had deployed his regulars between them and a little
marsh. Another marsh was five hundred yards further
on, to the right, and here the Indians under Tecumseh
were stationed, together with some British regulars.
The rest of the Indians were sent out in front, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
extreme right, in a position just in front of the swampy
bottom of the larger marsh. The ground was nearly
covered with an open growth of trees, without underbrush,
so that there was little impediment to fighting.
Harrison, as he came up, placed his mounted infantry in
front, for this was his strongest force, composed of a
splendid body of Kentucky frontiersmen under Colonel
Richard M. Johnson, all of whom were well used to
border warfare. The infantry was in the rear, with a
considerable body on the left flank, turned at right angle
to the line, so as to face the Indians in the marsh. They
were told to advance at the blast of the bugle and to
fight as they had done at Tippecanoe&mdash;commands
which they obeyed quite faithfully. At the shrill note
of the horn the horsemen trotted forward. Then, as
the British regulars began to pepper them with bullets,
they gave a wild cheer, galloped on, and soon were
charging right into the lines of the English.</p>

<p class="center">DEATH OF TECUMSEH.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Proctor knew that he was badly wanted by the
Americans, because of his numerous massacres of
defenseless non-combatants, and so leaped into a two-horse
vehicle in order to escape. But a dozen well-mounted
men galloped after him, and seeing that he
was about to be captured, the faint-hearted Britisher
jumped to the earth, took to the woods, and got safely
off. Tecumseh's men, meanwhile, stood their ground
and did not, at first, give way before the American
advance. But soon the savages posted upon the extreme
right before the marsh ran wildly into the woods.
The valiant Tecumseh was shot in the arm, but, disdaining
to fly, stood up manfully, while his wild, inspiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>war whoop was loudly heard above the din of battle.
Thus he was holding his own men to their work, when
the Kentucky cavalry, having dispersed Proctor's regulars,
returned to the field of battle. Forming for the
attack, they rushed, with a wild cheer, upon the mixed
battalion of reds and whites. Johnson, himself, was
soon near the great chief and shot at him with his pistol.
Tecumseh fell, whether from this shot, or not, is not
definitely known. The tide of conflict rolled by the
prostrate form of the mighty Shawnee, and, with
fierce cheers of victory, the Americans chased the now
routed British and Indians into the forest, securing a
complete and overwhelming victory.</p>

<p>Near the battlefield, where a large oak lay prostrate
by a willow marsh, the faithful Shawnees buried Tecumseh,
after the American army, flushed with success,
returned to the United States. The British Government
granted a pension to the widow of the noted
warrior, and to his son gave a sword. The willows and
rose-bushes now grow thick above the mound where
repose, in silence and solitude, the ashes of the mighty
chief of the Shawnees. He struggled in vain against
the inevitable, and his simple grave is only one of the
many monuments which mark the restless, overwhelming
advance of the conquering Americans. He fought
a good fight. His fame is secure upon the golden pages
of history.</p>

<h2>WEATHERFORD: THE CREEK CONSPIRATOR
AND FEARLESS FIGHTER</h2>


<p>Among the tribes who swore allegiance to Tecumseh,
none were more powerful than the Creeks,
who occupied a vast stretch of country in the
present states of Alabama and Tennessee. These Indians
continued their warfare against the whites, long
after the death of the famous leader of the Shawnees,
and, under the guidance of Weatherford, did great damage
to the white pioneers of this part of the country.
Weatherford was an extremely handsome savage of
fine face and figure. He was possessed of great physical
strength and dauntless courage, but he was treacherous
and merciless to those who fell into his clutches, and
was never known to give quarter to a fallen enemy.
For this reason he was hated and despised by the backwoodsmen
and pioneers of the Mississippi Territory.</p>

<p>The Creeks began their depredations upon the frontier
at the same time that Tecumseh's warriors were fighting
against Harrison, and soon the whites of the southern
country were forced to fly to the forts and stockades
for protection. The Southwestern militia was called
out to repel the attacks of the savages, and, under
Governor Claiborne, about two hundred volunteers
took station in a strong stockade called Fort Mimms,
situated on Lake Tensas, Alabama, and crowded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
refugees. A Major Beasley was placed in charge of
these soldiers, while Claiborne left for the interior of
the state in order to raise more troops. "Respect your
enemy, and be always ready to meet him," said he to
Major Beasley, when he was about to depart. "The
Indians are crafty, and one never knows when they
are to debouch from the dark recesses of the forest.
Be continually upon your guard, and do not fail to have
sentries at all times upon watch."</p>

<p>"I promise you that I will use every caution against
attack," Beasley replied. "Do not fear, it will be impossible
for the Indians to enter our stockade."</p>

<p>"Very good," the Governor answered, as he turned
to go. "I will be at Fort Early, the next stockade,
when the Indians advance, be sure and dispatch a
runner to me so that I can send you reinforcements, if
attacked." So saying, he turned on his heel and soon
had mounted his horse.</p>

<p>Not many days later, a negro, who had been sent to a
planter's house for a supply of corn, came running into
Fort Mimms in great agitation. "De Injuns am comin',"
he wailed. "De red men done took a feller dat was wid
me an' kill him. O Lawzy, Lawzy. I'se been runnin'
lak er rabbit!"</p>

<p>But Major Beasley scoffed at the news. "I don't believe
you, Sambo," said he. "For several of my own
men have been out scouting and have reported no sign
of Indians."</p>

<p>A few days after this, three negroes, while looking for
cattle which had strayed from the fort, suddenly ran
upon a large body of savages in the woods. Hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
returning to the stockade, they reported the matter,
with much fear and trembling. "I will send out scouts
at once," said the commandant of the fort, "and will
see if these reports are true." So a dozen rangers were
immediately dispatched into the forest to discover
signs of the Indians. They remained away for a day,
and, upon their return, stated that they had seen no
trace of the Creeks, and that they believed that the
negro had told an untruth. Consequently he was
flogged&mdash;an act of injustice which was to injure the
white refugees in Fort Mimms more than they expected,
or imagined.</p>

<p>Upon the following Monday this same negro was
driving some cattle to pasture, when he saw several
Indians in a cleared space, who were watching him
carefully, as if it was their intention to capture him
when he advanced near their position. Consequently
he ran back to Fort Mimms in a great state of agitation,
leaving his cattle to the tomahawks of the red men.
But he did not report the near approach of the Indians,
as he feared another thrashing, and so, when the shrill
warwhoops of the savages soon echoed from the forest,
the inhabitants of the stockade were totally unprepared
to meet the assault of the red men. To the number
of fifteen hundred they suddenly debouched from the
fringe of forest near the fort, and made a dash for the
palisade. Weatherford was in command, and, from a
position slightly in the rear of the line, directed the
operations of his men.</p>

<p>It was a hot day in August. The guard before the
doorway of the fort had been relaxed, and the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
lolled indolently in the shade of some trees. The heavy
gates were wide open. The garrison was scattered about
the enclosure, little expecting an onslaught from without,
while several small children were picking wild
flowers near the edge of the forest. Major Beasley,
himself, was occupied in one of the buildings, when
loud yells and rifle shots warned him of an Indian attack.
Rushing into the open, he saw, to his dismay,
that the Creeks had entered the stockade through the
gates which had been negligently standing ajar, and,
although several men in buckskin had endeavored to
close them, the onrush of the Indians swept all before
them. In a moment the frontiersmen and savages were
engaged in a desperate struggle. The whites, realizing
that it was a death grapple, vainly strove to keep the
followers of Weatherford from penetrating the stockade,
and, although there were nearly three hundred men
opposed to the redskins, it was soon evident that they
could scarcely hold their own against the furious attack
of the Creek warriors. Every officer of the American
troops was killed in his tracks. Yet the remaining
frontier fighters were unable to drive the Indians from
the entrance, and, in spite of their well-aimed rifle
shots, the savages gradually won their way into the
stockade. A Lieutenant, badly wounded, was carried
into a blockhouse by two of the women, but he insisted
upon being taken back into the fight, and was soon again
in the thick of the mêlée, where he was shot through
the body by an arrow and killed.</p>

<p>It was now about eleven o'clock. So many of the
whites had been killed that the rest had to seek safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
in one of the blockhouses, where, with both doors and
windows barricaded, they endeavored to make a last
resistance to the yelping Creeks. The women and children
were first huddled in the centre of the building, but
soon some of the women took up muskets and aided
the soldiers in the defense of this last resort. The
fighting was most furious at this moment, and, with a
heavy bar, the Creeks endeavored to break down the
doorway. Some others rolled lighted faggots against
the sides of the building, and, taking fire, the miserable
whites were burned to cinders. Seventeen members of
the garrison broke through the line of yelping Indians
and escaped, while Major Beasley, himself, was consumed
by the burning embers. When night fell, all was
ruin and desolation, where once had stood the strong
and presumably unpenetrable fortress of the frontier,
while the shrill wailing of the Indian women sounded
loud above the crackling of the burning stockade which
Weatherford ordered to be set on fire.</p>

<p>When the news of this frightful massacre at Fort
Mimms reached the interior, the white settlers were
roused to indescribable wrath against the Creek warriors.
Steps were immediately taken to guard against a further
advance of the Indians, and the sum of $300,000 was
donated by the state of Tennessee for raising and equipping
a number of troops to repel the invaders and, if
possible, to cripple their operations. Five thousand
rangers were soon collected on the frontier, and their
leadership given to a then undistinguished soldier,
called Andrew Jackson, who was later to become President
of the United States, because of the very qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of dauntless courage which he was to exhibit in the trying
Indian campaign before him. He had not yet fully
recovered from a severe wound received in a duel with
pistols, but, although badly crippled, he had sufficient
strength to give personal attention to the drill and
discipline of the splendid body of Indian fighters under
his command. Colonel Coffee, Davy Crockett, and Sam
Houston, all famous frontiersmen, were among his
soldiers, and, although thoroughly untrained in the
European method of warfare, they were well able to
handle a body of Indians of twice their strength.</p>

<p>After the massacre at Fort Mimms, Weatherford
had dropped back into his own territory, where his
followers had towns and resources. Some Georgian
troops, under Colonel Coffee, marched against him, but,
learning that Jackson was coming up, waited for him at
Ditto's Landing, on the Tennessee. Here many of the
white troops rebelled, as there was not a sufficiency
of food, but, brought to terms by the conduct and
oratory of the indomitable Jackson, they consented to a
further advance into the territory held by the warlike
Creeks.</p>

<p>Learning of the advance of this formidable body of
rangers, many of the Creeks, including Chief Chinnaboy,
gave themselves up to the whites and swore allegiance
to them. An Indian runner hastened to Weatherford,
urging him to capitulate without a struggle, but
to this the chief replied:</p>

<p>"I will never give in as long as I have ten men to fight
behind me. You can tell Chinnaboy that he is a traitorous
coward, and that, if I meet him, I will deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
him in the same manner that I would with one of my
white enemies."</p>

<p>The wily Creek leader also exhibited traits of excellent
generalship, for, when the combined forces of
Coffee and Jackson reached the vicinity of his encampment
at Ten Islands, he ordered a retreat of his followers
to a well-fortified town at Tallushatches (now Jacksonville,
Alabama), on the Southern shore of the Coosa
River. Jackson's men were suffering still from lack of
provisions and many were mutinous, but the remarkable
leader kept them at work with promises of future
pay and honors, and, when news was brought that a
large force of Creeks was besieging a friendly chief called
Path Killer, he divided his army. A portion, under
Colonel Coffee, was sent to attack Tallushatches, while
the rest were dispatched to the assistance of Path Killer.</p>

<p>Colonel Coffee had only nine hundred men with him,
and sent forward only a few of his soldiers to attack the
Indian stockade and then to retreat. He thus hoped
to entice the red men from their strong position, and his
plan was entirely successful. After making a vigorous
advance against the Creeks, his soldiers began to fall
back, and then to run away. The Indians hotly pursued,
thinking that they had the white men at their
mercy. But this is exactly what Coffee wished them to
do. His greater force was lying in ambuscade, and, as
the painted warriors rushed, yelping, after his flying
column, his other soldiers poured vigorous broadsides into
their ranks.</p>

<p>Dismayed and terrified, the followers of Weatherford
now turned to retreat, but the Americans surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
them entirely. Then ensued a sanguinary, hand-to-hand
encounter. Some of the red warriors broke through
the surrounding line and ran back to their village,
where they hid in the tepees. As long as they had
power to move a limb, they fought like tigers at bay. But
the white troops soon overcame all resistance, and killed
all of those who had, such a short time before, rushed
victoriously against them. Five of the Americans only
were killed, and forty-one were wounded, while about
two hundred Indians were put to death.</p>

<p>Weatherford was not with this division of his forces,
but, with a more powerful contingent, was besieging
the friendly Path Killer at Fort Talladega. Jackson
hurried to the relief of this place, and, because of very
swift marching, arrived there much sooner than the
Creeks had expected. But Weatherford was not taken
by surprise, and hurled his warriors against the militia
with such fury that they gave away. Jackson quickly
brought up some mounted rangers, who charged the oncoming
redskins with a will. In spite of Weatherford's
example and exhortations, his red warriors now broke
and ran. Three miles off was a range of densely wooded
mountains, and to this the Creeks hastened as fast as
their nimble limbs would carry them, while the Americans
followed in hot pursuit. Fully a thousand savages
fell before the onrush of the men in fringed buckskin,
while but fifteen of the American riflemen were killed.</p>

<p>As the Creeks, weary and disgruntled, rested in the
security of the mountains, a warrior approached Weatherford,
and said:</p>

<p>"Great Chief, I see that we can do nothing against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
these whites. They will conquer us, no matter how long
we resist. I, for one, am going to give myself up. As
for you, you can continue the war if you so will, but it
will be useless."</p>

<p>"Coward," shouted the Creek leader in great wrath.
"I will have your blood for such treachery!" And
with no more words, he struck the red man down with
his hatchet.</p>

<p>With Jackson things were also going ill. His men
grew so ill-humored with starvation that many revolted,
and there was danger of the expedition being abandoned.
One day, a starving soldier saw the General sitting
under a tree, eating something, and going to him, said:</p>

<p>"General Jackson, I can stand this no longer. If
you cannot furnish me with bread, I will go home, and
many others with me. Men, sir, cannot fight on empty
stomachs."</p>

<p>Jackson looked carefully at him before answering.</p>

<p>"You see that I am eating," said he. "I am always
ready to divide with a hungry man. Here, take half of
my supply of nourishment."</p>

<p>So saying, he reached in his pocket and extracted a
handful of acorns.</p>

<p>"Thank you, General," replied the soldier. "If you
can fight on such a diet, certainly I, myself, can." And
so saying, he walked off humming a tune. The example
of "Old Hickory" (as Jackson was nicknamed) was all
that allayed mutiny and dispersal among the men.</p>

<p>Weatherford now collected a large force upon an island
in the Tallapoosa River, near the mouth of Emuckfau
Creek, and, in this densely wooded and swampy country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
waited for the Americans to advance upon him. Fierce
and vindictive in his hatred for the superior race, he
determined to fight to the last ditch rather than to
capitulate to the men under Jackson, Coffee, and Floyd,
who headed the Georgia militia. Here he had built a
rude stockade, and, confident in his ability to withstand
an attack, waited for developments.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth of January, Jackson, with nearly
one thousand men, marched for the centre of the Indian
country, reinforced by Fife, a noted chief, with
about two hundred red warriors. As his soldiers pushed
through the rough country in the direction of Weatherford's
army, scouts from the latter's forces warned the
crafty chieftain of the approach of the white troops.
In the early morning of the twenty-second of January,
the left flank of the rangers was furiously attacked by
Weatherford's advance guard. Turning upon them,
the men under Old Hickory soon were engaged in a
furious battle. The underbrush and saplings impeded
good fighting, as they afforded good cover to the redskins,
but in spite of this, the buckskin rangers did as
much damage as the savages. In a half hour's time the
Creeks were routed, but, as the Americans rested and
re-arranged their line, the Indians returned to the fray.
Led on by Weatherford, in person, they did great damage
until finally driven off by a bayonet charge. As the
whites withdrew, because of a shortness in their provisions,
the Indians claimed this as a victory.</p>

<p>But Jackson only drew off to prepare for another
advance, while the Creeks determined to make a last
stand at the Great Horseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
River, in the state of Alabama. Weatherford had a
thousand warriors still left, although many had been
killed in the recent fighting with Old Hickory. He
had caused a well-fortified camp to be erected, which
was built with such skill that it could only be carried
by a direct assault. "We have been defeated many
times," said he to his warriors, "but now we <i>must</i> win a
battle. If the whites again defeat us, we shall be lost."</p>

<p>Jackson was now determined to crush the Indians
with an overwhelming blow. Consequently, on March
27th he reached the neighborhood of the Creeks' fortifications,
with a large and well-equipped army of frontiersmen
and friendly Indians. The rangers had all been
under fire; many of them had lost friends and relatives
in the massacre at Fort Mimms; and thus there was a
strong spirit of revenge among them. As they crept
silently through the forest they marched in single file,
and gave the impression of a huge earthworm, wriggling
through the dense undergrowth. Quietly and without
noise, the friendly Indians and mounted rangers were
sent across the river below the Indian encampment,
so as to cut off the retreat of the red men; while a small
body of expert riflemen was sent forward to set fire to
several buildings. As these crackled and burned in the
early morning light, the remaining troops opened fire
upon the breastworks, behind which the Creek warriors
were hiding.</p>

<p>For five hours the fighting raged. At first it seemed
impossible to get into the camp of Weatherford's adherents,
but eventually a number of the Tennessee
rangers managed to climb over the fallen logs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
timber, and to grapple single handed with the hostiles.
With a rousing cheer the rest of the rangers now rushed
over the barricade, driving many of the Creeks behind
their houses. A desperate struggle now took place,
but, seeing that they were about to be surrounded, many
of the Creeks, including Weatherford, made a wild
dash for freedom. Six hundred redskins were soon
killed, while over two hundred captives, including
women and children, were marched to the rear under a
strong guard. At nightfall the pursuit of the Creeks
was abandoned, and the battle of Tohopeka, or the Great
Horseshoe Bend, was over. The Creeks had suffered
such an overwhelming defeat that their spirit of resistance
was absolutely crushed.</p>

<p>Weatherford escaped into the forest, and nothing was
heard of him. Hundreds of his followers came to
Jackson's camp and gave themselves up in the week
following their defeat at Horseshoe Bend, for they
realized that further resistance would be impossible.
"I will accept your capitulation only on one condition,"
said Jackson to some of the Creek refugees. "And that
is that you deliver Weatherford to me, bound by deer
thongs. You must also allow me to do with him as
I see fit. I know that you wish for peace, but I cannot
guarantee it to you until your leader is in my hands.
He is an evil man, and I do not know when he will again
raise an insurrection."</p>

<p>Deep in the tangled forest, word was brought to
Weatherford of the wish of Old Hickory.</p>

<p>"I will never submit to being bound," cried the
Creek chieftain, "but I will surrender myself of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
free will, if this is the only way in which peace can be
assured. Were you people not cowards, I could yet
defeat this boasting General Jackson."</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the American commander was
sitting in his tent, dictating some dispatches, when
a tall and stately Indian suddenly stalked inside. As
Jackson, in amazement, gazed at him, the intruder
said:</p>

<p>"I am Weatherford, the chief who led the attack
upon Fort Mimms. I have come to ask for peace for
my people, who desire it."</p>

<p>Jackson looked at him with no cheerful gaze. "I
am surprised," said he, "that you should come into my
presence, for I know of your inhuman conduct at Fort
Mimms, for which you deserve death. I ordered that
you should be brought to me bound, and should you have
been brought to me in that manner, I should have
known how to treat you."</p>

<p>Weatherford smiled. "I am in your power," said
he. "You can do with me as you please, for I am a
soldier. I have done the whites all the harm that I
could. I have fought them and have fought them
bravely. If I had an army, I would yet fight; I would
contend to the last; but I have none. My people are
all gone. I can only weep over the misfortunes of my
nation."</p>

<p>Old Hickory was himself a brave man, and could
not help admiring the boldness of this handsome Indian
chieftain. A smile lighted his countenance, as he said:</p>

<p>"I will take no advantage of you; you may yet raise
a war party and fight us. But if you are captured, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
shall receive no quarter. Unconditional surrender is
the only safe measure for you and your people."</p>

<p>Weatherford drew himself up in a dignified manner,
and replied:</p>

<p>"You can now safely address me in such terms. There
was a time when I could have answered you; there was
a time when I had a choice; I have none now. I have
not even a hope. I could once animate my warriors to
battle, but I cannot animate the dead. My warriors
can no longer hear my voice. Their bones are at
Talladega, Tallushatches, Emuckfau, and Tohopeka.
I have not surrendered myself without thought. While
there was a single chance for success, I never left my
post nor supplicated for peace. But my people are gone,
and I now ask it for my nation, not for myself. I look
back with deep sorrow, and wish to avert still greater
calamities. If I had been left only to contend with
the army from Georgia, I would have raised my corn on
one bank of the river, and fought them on the other.
But your people have destroyed my nation. You are a
brave man. I rely upon your generosity. You will
exact no terms of a conquered people but such as they
should accede to. Whatever they may be, it would
now be madness and folly to oppose them. If they are
opposed, you shall find me among the sternest enforcers
of obedience. Those who would still hold out can be
influenced only by a mean spirit of revenge. To this
they must not, and shall not sacrifice the last remnant
of their country. You have told our nation where we
might go and be safe. This is good talk, and they ought
to listen to it. They <i>shall</i> listen to it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go," answered Jackson, "if you so will. I shall
not hinder you. But, if you rouse further strife, beware
of me and my men. We shall deal with you, next time,
with no careful hand."</p>

<p>The great leader of the Creeks thus departed, as
proudly arrogant as he had come, and soon his form was
lost in the shadows of the forest.</p>

<h2>BLACK HAWK: CHIEF OF THE SACS AND FOXES AND LEADER OF THE
BLACK HAWK REBELLION</h2>


<p>Step by step the whites were fighting their way
across the country, and in 1832 had frontier
settlements in the territory between the Illinois
and the Mississippi rivers. The Sacs and the Foxes
here had their towns, their principal leader being Black
Hawk, a man of splendid physique and noble bearing.
He was not only a warrior, but was also an orator of
distinction and ability, many of his speeches possessing
a poetical eloquence which is remarkable. Personally
he was a brave man, but he showed no special generalship
in handling his forces, and, although at first successful
in attacking the whites, he soon was overwhelmed
by the superior ability and prowess of the
men of another race.</p>

<p>In 1830 the Sacs and Foxes, through a chief named
Keokuk as negotiator, sold much of their land to the
United States and agreed to move to the west of the
Mississippi. Black Hawk was not consulted in this
matter, and became very indignant when he learned
what had transpired. Finding that a considerable
number of Indians were dissatisfied with the treaty, he
offered to place himself at their head and to rebel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>against Keokuk. But open rebellion did not occur,
because of difficulties with the whites, which soon
turned the vindictive spirit of Black Hawk against
them, and not against the men of his own race. The
act which led to hostilities was peculiar.</p>

<p>One of the Sacs found a beehive in a hollow tree, and
carried it to his wigwam. Some of the white squatters
claimed that it was theirs and made the Indian give it
up. But not content with this, they now plundered
the savage's wigwam of all the skins which he had collected
by hunting in the winter. When the Indian protested,
they laughed at him, and thus ill-blood was
aroused between the whites and the redskins, which
finally culminated in open warfare. "We must have
war," said Black Hawk in the council chamber, "or
else we shall be driven into the far West, without lands,
horses, or shelter. Those of you who are cowards may
follow Keokuk, but those of you who wish to maintain
your own against the aggressions of these whites, must
take up your tomahawks with me."</p>

<p>An old residence of the tribe was the Sac village,
situated upon a point of land at the confluence of the
Mississippi and Rock Rivers, which had been occupied
by them for over a century and a half. As this spot
was in the limits of the ceded territory, the Americans
demanded the evacuation of the village, but Black
Hawk convinced Keokuk that his cession of land was
illegal and made him promise to open a negotiation
with the Americans, and to have the village restored.
With this expectation the Indians still kept possession
of the village, until the autumn of the year 1830, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
they went into the deep forests, as usual, for their
winter's hunt after furs. No sooner had they departed
than the whites occupied the tepees and houses in the
village, and when the Indians returned, they found that
hundreds of white men and women were in their own
wigwams. These refused to leave, claiming that the
village rightly belonged to them, and so angered the
savages by their obstinacy that the chiefs of the allied
tribes of Sacs and Foxes determined to drive them out
by force.</p>

<p>The white settlers were not in sufficient numbers to
oppose the savages, and, realizing their weakness,
offered to compromise by living in company with the
tribe. Strange as it may seem, the Indians agreed to
this, but soon regretted their bargain, as the whites
appropriated all the best planting lands, crowded the
red men out of their homes, and at length told them
that they must leave the village. Many complied, but
Black Hawk and a number of warriors refused to move;
a fact which led the whites to complain to the Governor
of Illinois of the "encroachments of the Indians, and
unfair dealings of the Sacs and Foxes."</p>

<p>"I will immediately send the militia to your assistance,"
wrote the Governor to the complaining citizens.
"I furthermore proclaim that the state has been
invaded by foreign enemies. The soldiers are for the
public defense. They will remove the Indians, dead or
alive, to their proper position across the Mississippi
River." Seven hundred militiamen began an immediate
advance upon the settlement, but General Gaines,
the commander of the United States troops in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
section of country, foreseeing that this movement would
provoke the Indians to open hostilities, hurried to Rock
River in order to mediate between the soldiers and
redskins. He arrived before the Illinois militia had
reached the ground, and, by means of a long harangue,
persuaded about a third of the Indians to peacefully
retire across the river. The rest, including Black Hawk,
refused to leave the place, the women imploring their
husbands to fight rather than to abandon their homes.</p>

<p>Seeing that he would have to use his best powers
of persuasion, Gaines held a council with Black Hawk on
the seventh of June, and there argued for peace for over
an hour. The savage leader was painted and armed
for battle, and was surrounded by many of his best
warriors. "I am not afraid of the Americans," said he,
"and I will not remove from my rightful possessions.
I am fully able to make war against your soldiers, and
to drive them into the sea, if necessary. Let your
men come on. I am ready to receive them." Notwithstanding
their proud boasts, as soon as the militia
came up on the twenty-fifth, the followers of Black
Hawk abandoned their position without firing a gun.
Two days later, Black Hawk made his appearance
again, with a white flag, and demanded another parley,
after which a treaty was agreed upon, whereby he and
his malcontents relinquished their claim to the territory
under dispute. Satisfied with this turn of affairs, the
militia withdrew.</p>

<p class="center">BLACK HAWK.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Peace was to be of short duration, for the Indians
still retained their feelings of exasperation caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>the treatment which they had received, and the Americans
did not live up to the terms of their treaty. As
usual, they scoffed at the requests of the redskins, and
told them that their demands were unjust, when they
asked for a supply of corn which had been promised them.
Black Hawk's men grew bold and surly. Early in
1831 they attacked a band of peaceable Sioux, encamped
near an American fort at Prairie du Chien, and killed
twenty-eight. This exasperated the white settlers, and
a demand was made for the murderers. Black Hawk
refused to deliver them up. "This is an affair between
two Indian tribes, independent of the authority of the
Great White Father," said he. "I will not give up my
people, because of this. You can do what you like
about it." As the murdered men were, at the time of
the killing, under the protection of the United States
Government, the Indian chief was, of course, in the
wrong.</p>

<p>It was now the spring of the year 1832, and Black
Hawk had collected a force of Sacs, Foxes and Winnebagoes
amounting to about a thousand warriors. Crossing
the Mississippi, the redskins marched upon the
frontier settlements, burning and scalping with a ruthless
hand, and driving the white inhabitants before
them in alarm. Farms were abandoned; remote
settlements were left to their fate; while forts and
stockades were crowded with refugees. The Governor
of Illinois ordered out a brigade of militia, and, under
General Atkinson, the soldiers marched for the scene
of hostilities. Regular troops soon joined with the
state militia, so that three thousand four hundred men
were marching towards the arrogant chief of the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>bellious Indians. Black Hawk saw that he could not
cope with such a force, and so withdrew from the open
country into the swamps, from the protection of which
he sent out marauding parties against the settlements.
The country was in the greatest fear and alarm.</p>

<p>Atkinson halted for reinforcements and dispatched
a Major Stillman with two hundred and seventy men
to make a reconnoissance in the direction of Black
Hawk's hiding place. Learning of their approach, the
chief sent out three of his warriors with a flag of truce,
and an invitation to the officers to visit his camp. The
white soldiers paid no attention to the flag, took the
Indians prisoners, and killed two other Winnebagoes
who came up to look for their first party, when the
emissaries did not return. This was not the boasted
method of warfare which the white man prided himself
upon, and it naturally enfuriated the followers of Black
Hawk. There were but forty in the camp, as the rest
were out hunting, and, when the whites pressed forward
to the attack, these armed themselves for the fray, and
quietly waited for the rangers to approach. The latter
advanced in much disorder, crossed a narrow creek,
and were confidently pushing towards Black Hawk's
camp, when they were fiercely assailed by the savages.
Although outnumbering the redskins, they were no
match for them, and soon were thrown into great disorder.
Their situation finally became so desperate that
the retreat was sounded on the bugle, and they ran away
in great confusion. It was a signal triumph for the
savages.</p>

<p>More troops were ordered to join with Atkinson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Five companies of artillery made a rapid march of eighteen
days from Fortress Monroe, on the Chesapeake, to
Chicago, on Lake Michigan, but were attacked by
cholera on the route, so that all were unfit for service
before they even reached the seat of war. Only nine
were left alive in one entire corps. Many men already
at the front deserted. Some died in the woods, and
their bodies were devoured by wolves. Others straggled
into the settlements with their knapsacks on their
backs, staggering from faintness and wounds. They
were shunned by the inhabitants as the source of a
mortal disease, and were left to shift for themselves.
General Scott, who was advancing with reinforcements,
directed Atkinson to pursue the campaign without
waiting for him, as his entire force was knocked out by
the dread scourge, so the American leader determined
for an immediate advance upon the warriors of the
now much-feared leader of the Indian forces.</p>

<p>As the frontier soldiers scoured the country in the
endeavor to drive the savages from their lurking-places,
Black Hawk began to retreat. Abandoning a camp
which he had formed at the Four Lakes, he moved towards
the Mississippi, having been assured by the
tribes who lived in this quarter that they would not only
join his party, but would also furnish him with plentiful
supplies and provisions. He was to be grievously
disappointed. No allies joined him, no provisions were
brought to his camp, and scouts told him that the
Americans were close upon his trail. As he was about
to cross the Wisconsin River, about forty miles from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>frontier fortress, called Fort Winnebago, he was attacked
by an advanced body of the Americans, under
General Dodge. The fight began just at dusk, and,
although sixteen of the red men were slain, the rest
escaped across the stream. Many of the women and
children were captured by the white soldiers as they
attempted to run down the river in canoes, and many
of them were drowned, as their frail barques were sunk
by the fire of the frontiersmen.</p>

<p>The once boastful Indian chief was now terrified by
the advance of his despised enemies, and his vaunted
courage had ebbed with the decay of his fortunes. Had
he been a Tecumseh, or a King Philip, he would have
made one last desperate stand against the whites, and
would have died at the head of his rebellious warriors.
He had suffered no wrong from the white settlers beyond
that of personal insult, and, although he had been
driven from the home of his forefathers, it had been only
after a treaty with members of his tribe. Yet, it is
hard to restrain our sympathy for him and his people,
for now, surrounded on three sides, his one thought was
of safety, and he was bent solely on the means of escape
for the remnant of his fighting force.</p>

<p>On August 1st, as he was attempting to cross the
Mississippi, he was interrupted by an armed steamboat,
called the <i>Warrior</i>, the Captain of which has written
the following account of the engagement which then
took place:</p>

<p>"I was dispatched with the <i>Warrior</i> alone to Wapashaw's
village, one hundred and twenty miles above
Prairie du Chien, to inform them of the approach of
Black Hawk, and to order down all the friendly Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
to Prairie du Chien. On the way down we met one of
the Sioux band, who informed us that the Indians
(under Black Hawk) were on Bad Axe River, to the
number of four hundred. We stopped to cut some
wood and prepare for action. About four o'clock on
Wednesday afternoon (August 1st), we found the
<i>Gentlemen</i> where he stated that he had left them. As
we neared them, they raised a white flag and endeavored
to decoy us, but we were a little too old for them, and,
instead of landing, ordered them to send a boat on
board, which they declined. After some fifteen minutes'
delay, giving them time to remove a few of their women
and children, we let slip a six-pounder, loaded with
canister, followed by a severe fire of musketry, and if
ever you saw straight blankets (Indians running) you
would have seen them there. I fought them at anchor
most of the time, and we were all very much exposed.
I have a ball which came in close by where I was standing
and passed through the bulkhead of the wheel-room.
We fought them for about an hour or more,
until our wood began to fail, and, night coming on, we
left and went on to the Prairie. This little fight cost
them twenty-three killed, and, of course, a great many
wounded. We never lost a man, and had but one
wounded&mdash;shot through the leg. The next morning,
before we could get back again, they had the whole of
General Atkinson's army upon them. We found them
at it, walked in and took a hand ourselves. The first
shot from the <i>Warrior</i> laid out three. I can hardly tell
you anything about it, for I am in great haste, as I am
now on my way to the field again. The army lost eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
or nine killed, and seventeen wounded, whom we brought
down. One died on deck, last night. We brought
down thirty-six prisoners, women and children. There
is no fun in fighting Indians, particularly at this season,
when the grass is bright."</p>

<p>What he says of Atkinson's arrival is only too true.
Atkinson arrived with a vengeance, and, after a three
hours' action, totally defeated the Indians; great numbers
of them being driven into the Mississippi and
drowned, or captured, by the American sharpshooters.
Black Hawk stole away and got safely off, during the
action, leaving all his baggage behind him, and certificates
signed by British officers, testifying to his good
character and excellent services rendered by him to the
British cause in the war of 1812. With a small party,
he reached the Winnebago village of Prairie du Chien,
and, despairing of eluding his persevering pursuers,
told the chiefs of this settlement that he wished to surrender
himself to the whites, and that, if they wished,
they might put him to death. But the Winnebago warriors
did him no harm. Their women presented him with
a suit of white tanned deerhide, as a testimonial to his
bravery and gallantry; made much of him, and crowded
about the renowned chieftain in wonder and delight.
After a few days of rest he was accompanied by two
Winnebago chiefs to the headquarters of General Street,
where he was delivered into the hands of the American
General.</p>

<p>The soldier was seated at a table, when the famous
warrior entered, and, greeting him cordially, he asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>him if he had anything to say for himself. The captured
chieftain drew himself up to his full height, and
then spoke in a slow and majestic manner. Although
renowned only as a warrior, his oratory is quite equal
to that of Red Jacket and other famous speakers of the
Indian race; and had he not been noted as a war chieftain,
his speeches would have given him distinction
among those of his own color.</p>

<p>"You have taken me prisoner with all my warriors,"
said he. "I am much grieved, for I expected, if I did
not defeat you, to hold out much longer and give you
more trouble before I surrendered. I tried hard to
bring you into ambush, but your last general understands
Indian fighting. The first one was not so wise.
When I saw that I could not beat you by Indian fighting,
I determined to rush on you and fight you face to face.
I fought hard. But your guns were well aimed. The
bullets flew like birds in the air, and whizzed by our
ears like the wind through the trees in winter. My
warriors fell around me; it began to look dismal. I
saw my evil day at hand. The sun rose dim on us in
the morning, and at night it sunk in a dark cloud, and
looked like a ball of fire. That was the last sun that
shone on Black Hawk. His heart is dead and no longer
beats quick in his bosom. He is now a prisoner to the
white man; they will do with him as they wish. But
he can stand torture, and is not afraid of death. He
is no coward. Black Hawk is an Indian.</p>

<p>"He has done nothing for which an Indian has been
ashamed. He has fought for his countrymen, the
squaws, and pappooses, against white men, who came
year after year to cheat him and take away their lands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
You know the cause of our making war. It is known
to all white men. They ought to be ashamed of it.
The white men despise the Indians and drive them
from their homes. But the Indians are not deceitful.
The white men speak bad of the Indian and look at him
spitefully. But the Indian does not tell his. Indians
do not steal.</p>

<p>"Black Hawk is a true Indian and disdains to cry
like a woman. He feels for his wife, his children, and
friends. But he does not care for himself. He cares
for his nation and the Indians. They will suffer. He
laments their fate. The white men do not scalp the
head; but they do worse, they poison the heart; it is
not pure with them. His countrymen will not be
scalped, but they will, in a few years, become like the
white men, so that you can't trust them, and there must
be, as in the white settlements, nearly as many officers
as men, to take care of them and keep them in order.</p>

<p>"Farewell, my nation! Black Hawk tried to save
you and avenge your wrongs. He drank the blood
of some of the whites. He has been taken prisoner, and
his plans are stopped. He can do no more. He is near
his end. His sun is setting, and he will rise no more.
Farewell to Black Hawk."</p>

<p>Although much impressed by this oration, the General
ordered the noted chief to be made a prisoner, and sent
to Washington to confer with Andrew Jackson, who
was the President. Arriving at the seat of government,
the celebrated warrior was soon ushered into the presence
of the chief magistrate, whom he greeted with the
words: "I am a man and you are another. Do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
me as you will. I know that you will give me fair
treatment."</p>

<p>Later on, he said: "We did not expect to conquer
the whites, no. They had too many houses; too many
men. I took up the hatchet, for my part, to revenge
the injuries which my people could no longer endure.
Had I borne them longer without striking, my people
would have said, 'Black Hawk is a woman; he is too
old to be a chief; he is a Sac.' These reflections caused
me to raise the warwhoop. I say no more of it; it is
known to you. Keokuk once was here; you took him
by the hand, and, when he wished to return to his home,
you were willing. Black Hawk expects that, like
Keokuk, we shall be permitted to return, too."</p>

<p>"You must feel no uneasiness about your women and
children," said the President. "They will be looked
after and will be protected from their Indian enemies.
You must promise me never to lift the hatchet again
against the white man, and then you can return to your
own race."</p>

<p>Having secured the necessary promise, Black Hawk,
with some companions, was sent to Norfolk, Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New York, where he was amazed and
much flattered by the immense crowds of spectators
who flocked from all quarters to obtain a view of him.
The sight of the navy yards, arsenals, and ships of war
made him realize the weakness and insignificance of his
own nation compared with the Americans, and, upon
viewing some troops in New York, he exclaimed: "I
once thought that I could conquer the whites, my heart
grew bitter and my hands grew strong. But the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
men were mighty. I and my people failed. I see the
strength of the white men. I will be the white man's
friend. I will go to my people and speak good of the
white men. I will tell them that they are like the
leaves of the forest, very many, very strong, and that
I will fight no more against them."</p>

<p>From New York the Indians returned by way of
Albany and the Great Lakes to the Upper Mississippi,
where they were set at liberty. No incident worthy of
record took place for three years after his liberation,
until the summer of 1837, when a battle occurred between
the Sacs and Foxes, on one hand, and the Sioux
upon the other, in which this noted chieftain participated.
The remainder of his life was peaceful enough,
as he was honored by both reds and whites. Invited
to a dinner at a Fourth of July celebration at Fort
Madison, Wisconsin, he was seated to the right of the
toastmaster, who spoke of him as follows, when his
health was proposed:</p>

<p>"Our illustrious guest. May his declining years be
as calm as his previous life has been boisterous and
filled with warlike events. His present friendship to the
whites fully entitles him to a seat at our board."</p>

<p>To which the now aged warrior responded:</p>

<p>"It has pleased the Great Spirit that I am here today.
The earth is our mother, and we are now permitted
to look upon it. A few snows ago I was fighting against
the white people; perhaps I was wrong; let it be forgotten.
I love my towns and cornfields on the Rock
River; it is a beautiful country. I fought for it, but
it is now yours. Keep it as the Sacs did. I was once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>a warrior, but I am now poor. I love to look upon the
Mississippi. I have looked upon it from a child. I love
the beautiful river. My home has always been upon its
banks. I thank you for your friendship. I will say
no more."</p>

<p>Black Hawk&mdash;the orator, and defeated, though not
crestfallen chieftain&mdash;died October 3rd, 1838. Many
whites, as well as Indians, assembled at his tepee to pay
their last respects to the noted red man, and buried
him as the Sac chieftains had always been interred.
This was according to his wish. Instead of covering his
body with earth, it was placed upon the ground in a
sitting posture, with a cane between the knees, supporting
the hands. Slabs and rails were then piled around the
remains, and the bones of Black Hawk were left to the
care of the elements. During the following winter the
body was stolen, and a year later was found in the
possession of a surgeon of Quincy, Illinois. But the
Governor of Iowa, learning of this outrage, compelled
the thieving medical man to restore the skeleton of the
noted warrior to his friends. These interred the bones
of the chief beneath the ground, with a simple headstone
to mark the last resting place of the once powerful
warrior of the Sacs and Foxes.</p>

<h2>OSCEOLA: THE SNAKE OF THE
FLORIDA EVERGLADES</h2>


<p>In a rude stockade in Florida, an officer of the United
States Government sat before a rough-hewn table,
upon which was laid the papers of an Indian treaty.
It was the year 1832. Before him stood several Seminole
chieftains, one of whom was nearly white and
had a sharp, intelligent and crafty-looking countenance.</p>

<p>"You see," said the American soldier, pointing to the
paper, "by the terms of this agreement, you Seminoles
are to give up all your possessions in Florida, are to
receive $15,400 upon arriving at your new home, and
shall each have a blanket. Your women will each have
a new homespun frock. Seven of your chiefs must consent
to this agreement before it becomes a law. That
is the will of our great father, President Jackson."</p>

<p>"I will sign your paper," said one of the gaudily-attired
Seminoles, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"And I, also," said another.</p>

<p>But he of the sharp features jumped quickly between
them and the parchment. It was Osceola, half Indian
and half white, a redskin of treacherous courage and implacable
hatred for the whites.</p>

<p>"I shall never sign these lies," said he with violence,
"you whites are all cowards and cheats!" and, seizing
his long knife in his right hand, he plunged it through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>the paper with such force that it went clean through the
table upon which it lay. Then turning haughtily, he
left the room, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The officer wrote to Washington that, in spite of the
opposition of some of the chiefs, the treaty would be
ratified by the Indians and they would leave their homes
in the Everglades and swamps to the possession of the
whites. But, in this, he was mistaken. It became
apparent that the Seminoles intended to fight rather
than to give up their lands to the white pioneers. A
General Thompson called the real leaders of these
Southern redskins to another conference, in October,
1834, and said:</p>

<p>"I have told you that you must stand to your bargain;
my talk is the same. Your father, the President, who
is your friend, will compel you to go. Therefore, be
not deluded by any hope or expectation that you will be
permitted to remain here."</p>

<p>"We will remain and will fight," answered the spokesman
of the chiefs.</p>

<p>Six months later, they were again called together
to hear the message of their father, President Jackson,
the great white chief in Washington. General Thompson
read them the message of this wise statesman,
which ran:</p>

<p>"My children, I am sorry to have heard that you have
been listening to bad counsel. You know me, and you
know that I would not deceive you, nor advise you to
do anything that was unjust or injurious. Open your
ears and attend now to what I am going to say to you.
They are the words of a friend, and the words of truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>"The white people are settling round you. The game
has disappeared from your country. Your people are
poor and hungry. All this you have perceived for some
time. And nearly three years ago you made an agreement
with your friend, Colonel Gadsen, acting on the part of
the United States, by which you agreed to cede your
lands in Florida, and to remove and join your brothers,
the Creeks, in the country west of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>After going into the terms of the treaty, the message
concluded with:</p>

<p>"I now learn that you refuse to carry into effect the
solemn promises thus made by you, and that you have
stated to the officers of the United States that you will
not remove to the Western country. My children, I
have never deceived you, nor will I ever deceive any of
the red people. I tell you that you must go, and you
will go.... But lest some of your rash men should
forcibly oppose your arrangements for removal, I have
ordered a large military force to be sent among you....
Should you listen to the bad birds that are always
flying about you, and refuse to go, I have directed the
commanding officer to remove you by force. This will
be done. I pray the Great Spirit, therefore, to incline
you to do what is right."</p>

<p>This strong appeal divided the Seminoles, a considerable
number consenting to their removal; but
Osceola would not hear of such a step, and, when protesting
against the matter in the presence of General
Thompson, grew so angry that he drew a knife. "Arrest
this man, immediately!" cried the now irate soldier,
"and put him in irons until further orders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>Maddened and outraged by this treatment, Osceola
secretly swore revenge. The devil rose in the soul of
this mongrel of the Florida canebrakes, and he made an
oath to never rest until he had the life blood of General
Thompson. But, simulating a spirit of peace, he agreed
to sign the treaty, and to do all in his power to persuade
his people to follow his example. He was playing a
part, and his true nature soon asserted itself, after
seventy-nine of his people (men, women, and children)
signed the compact with the Government of the United
States at Fort King. Osceola, himself, put his name
to the deed, but two weeks later shot down a white
interloper who had penetrated the dense jungle of the
Everglades, where he had made his home. Soon all of
the Seminoles were in arms, and the Government of the
United States was plunged into a desperate conflict,
which was to last for seven long and tedious years.</p>

<p>There were three important and crucial events in
this bitter struggle. One was the annihilation of Major
Dade and his men; another the shooting of General
Thompson, and a third the capture and death of the
crafty and treacherous Osceola.</p>

<p>Only five hundred regular troops of the United States
army were in Florida in the fall of 1836. One company
was at St. Augustine; six were in the centre of the state
at Fort King, and three were near what is now the town
of Tampa, at Fort Brooke on Hillsboro Bay. "Two
companies will leave Fort Brooke on December 16th,
to meet an equal number from Fort King near the
forks of the Ouithlacoochee River, in order to make an
active campaign against the Seminoles," wrote General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Clinch, the director of the Southern army at that time,
to the commander at Fort Brooke. So, collecting the
necessary men, that part of the expedition which was
to come from Fort Brooke was soon made up, placed
under the charge of Major Francis L. Dade, who had
fought gallantly at Tippecanoe twenty-five years before,
and, with one hundred and nine effectives, and
a guide (half negro and half Spanish) started towards
the place of rendezvous. One six-pound cannon, drawn
by four oxen, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>The troops were not able to make speedy progress,
for tangled weeds, branches, and vines grew across the
roadway in dense confusion. In four days they only
went sixty-five miles into the jungle, in whose dank and
soggy depths the keen eyes of Osceola's men watched
like ferrets. Lean-bodied warriors crept like snakes
through the undergrowth, by paths known to themselves
alone, and kept their cruel chieftain continually
advised of the advance of the little army. Even the
half-breed guide was a spy and a traitor; he had told
the Seminoles by what route the whites were to advance,
and had hinted to them that it would be an excellent
opportunity to annihilate the entire band. Osceola
prepared to do so, and, in a place favorable for attack,
collected a strong body of half-naked and well-armed
redskins.</p>

<p>On December the 28th, Major Dade's little battalion
crossed the waters of the Ouithlacoochee and marched
slowly along the sandy trail which was the only road.
The ground was rather open and covered with a sparse
growth of tropical palmettos. On the right was a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
pond, surrounded by a swampy marsh, overgrown
with rank grass, five feet high, and scrubby bushes
and trees. On the left it was open and without much
grass. The troops pushed on unsuspectingly, but behind
the rank growth of weeds several hundred Seminoles,
under Micanopy, lay in ambush. Osceola was away upon
a mission of death, and had left strict orders that not a
savage was to fire his piece until the signal was given.</p>

<p>The Americans were strung out in a long line, and
were totally unsuspicious of any attack. Two Lieutenants
were in the advance, and after them marched
Major Dade with the main force, the six-pounder in the
midst of the light-hearted soldiers. They trudged
along singing, but Micanopy had his eye upon the leader
of the expedition, and, as he passed by, the Indian took
careful aim at his head. <i>Crack!</i> a rifle shot rang out upon
the clear air, the gallant Major fell prostrate to the
ground, and, with a wild, blood-curdling warwhoop,
the Seminole warriors discharged a gruelling volley into
the advancing column. The two Lieutenants in front
immediately went down. The suddenness of the attack
appalled and staggered the Americans.</p>

<p>But, although staggered, there was no panic, and the
whites were not disorganized. With immediate promptitude
the soldiers fell back from the road into the trees,
and returned the rifle fire of their savage enemies.
Crouching behind fallen logs and palmetto stumps, they
only discharged their muskets when they saw a redskin
show himself, and so accurate was their fire that the
attackers finally withdrew. For forty minutes the
battle had raged with fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>About fifty Americans were now left, and, with a
knowledge of Indian tactics that is commendable, they
instantly began to fell trees for a breastwork in the
form of a triangle. The wounded were carried to the
centre, and the six-pounder was placed where it could
rake the oncoming foe. Working with desperation, the
whites had succeeded in raising a protecting barrier,
three tree trunks high, when a terrible yell from the
forest of palmettos announced another Indian attack.
The Seminoles poured a destructive fire into the little
fort. Men fell upon every side, but with stolid and
grim determination, the soldiers fought on in silence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the soldiers, their palisade was in
a slight hollow, so the Indians commanded it from all
sides. Lieutenant Keais lay helpless against the breastwork
with both arms broken, until killed by a bullet
through the head. Another officer, Henderson, continued
to load and fire his musket with a broken arm,
until dispatched by a leaden missile in the chest. A
Doctor did great damage with two double-barreled
shotguns, until finally knocked over by the accurate
fire of some Seminoles who had crawled into the trees.
Captain Gardiner was seen by one of the survivors to
fall, crying out: "I can give no more orders, my brave
boys. Do your best!" But soon there was no more
fire from the log breastworks; the Indians swarmed into
the rude fort, and it was all over with Major Dade's
battalion.</p>

<p>Although the Seminoles took many scalps, they left
three men alive, who feigned death, and, as they were
bodily wounded, looked as if they had suffered the fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
of all. One of them was shot by a lurking warrior when
he tried to get away. The other two, however, crawled
off towards Fort Brooke, sixty-five miles through the
Everglades, and one of them reached this haven of
refuge. The third was shot by a Seminole. When
news of the annihilation of Dade's men reached civilization,
it sent a thrill of horror through the entire country,
and made the whites more determined than ever to
annihilate the followers of Osceola.</p>

<p>This chief, it will be remembered, had sworn vengeance
against General Thompson for throwing him in irons,
and now was to have his oath fulfilled. The General
was, on December 28th, dining with nine other gentlemen
at the storehouse of Mr. Rogers, two hundred and
fifty yards from Fort King. As the weather was mild,
doors and windows were thrown open wide. The repast
was a good one, wine was upon the table, and it is said
that one officer had proposed a toast: "To the speedy
capture of that knave Osceola and a termination of the
war." No sooner had the words left him than a volley
rang out. The officer dropped to the ground, mortally
wounded; a wild yell sounded in the ears of those who
survived this sudden and unexpected assault, and
Osceola bounded into the room, followed by a dozen
warriors.</p>

<p>At the first fire, General Thompson had been struck
and had fallen prostrate to the ground. Leaping to his
bleeding form, Osceola scalped him, held his hand aloft,
and uttered a yell of triumph which was long remembered
by all who heard it. Five others lay dead upon
the ground. Those who were not killed leaped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
the windows and fled. Five of them, who were fortunate
enough to start towards the fort, escaped; but the others,
who dashed towards a sheltering hill of sand, near by,
were shot down by the skillful Seminoles. The cook,
who was a negro woman, crouched behind a barrel in
a dark corner, and was so thoroughly protected by her
color that she was not seen by Osceola, who, pausing
for a moment to take another scalp, darted out again,
uttering a peculiarly shrill and piercing yell, so that
those in the fort might know who was the leader of this
bloody attack. His vengeance had been complete.</p>

<p>After this tragic affair the war continued as before.
The Seminoles increased in numbers, through additions
of runaway negroes and criminals from the Creeks and
other tribes adjoining. Their strength seemed to be
greater than usual, and, when driven into a corner,
they fought like wildcats, without any thought of surrender.
All Florida was in a panic of fear. The fugitives
from Seminole wrath were reduced to such sore
straits that Congress passed a bill to send them food
and clothing until peace could be declared. To such
extremities was the Government driven, that a force of
one thousand Southern and Western Indians was enlisted
to help subjugate the dreaded Seminoles.</p>

<p>In the last days of October, 1837, a solitary Indian
was one day seen in the edge of the timber before Fort
Peyton. He held up his hand in token of peace, and,
being allowed to approach nearer, said: "I have a
talk from Osceola to Big Chief."</p>

<p>"What does he want?" asked the sentry who had
challenged him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>"He not far off. Wish to speak with Big Chief
Jessup" (the commander of this stockade).</p>

<p>"I will give him Osceola's message," said the sentry.</p>

<p>When General Jessup heard that the savage Seminole
was near by, he immediately devised a scheme for capturing
him. Finding that he could not entice him into
the fort, he ordered one of his officers, with over a hundred
soldiers, to seize the Seminole chief, under cloak
of a flag of truce. This sharp trick was successfully
operated, and, although it was a piece of the most
flagrant treachery, the wily enemy to white government
was at last secured. The affair is a perpetual stain upon
the honor of the United States.</p>

<p>In spite of his vigorous protests, Osceola was sent to
St. Augustine and afterwards confined in the dungeon
at Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South Carolina. Crushed
by the humiliating position to which he had sunk, and
brooding over the misfortunes of his race, he pined away
and died within a year. The war kept on as vigorously
as before, and did not terminate until 1842. Then the
great bulk of the Seminoles was sent beyond the
Mississippi, and a few, who were harmless, were allowed
to remain in Florida.</p>

<p>The skeletons of the unfortunate soldiers who fell
with the gallant Major Dade were collected, and buried
in St. Augustine with appropriate ceremonies. A
monument was erected to the memory of these courageous
men. At West Point is also another monument,
the inscription upon which reads:</p>

<p>"To commemorate the Battle of the 28th of December,
Between a Detachment of 108 U. S. Troops and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Seminole Indians, of Florida, In which all the Detachment
Save Three Fell Without an Attempt to Retreat."</p>

<p>All honor to these brave men who, dying with their
face to the foe, nobly upheld the finest traditions of the
army of the United States!</p>

<h2>ROMAN NOSE: THE CUSTER OF THE
CHEYENNES</h2>


<p>All the world admires a brave man, whether he
be of red, black, or yellow complexion. All the
world respects the leader of a gallant cavalry
charge, whether it be successful or not. The British
leader of the heroic 600 has been celebrated in both
prose and poetry. The gallant Von Bredow of the
Franco-Prussian War; the fearless Custer; the impetuous
Farnsworth of Gettysburg fame, have all had their
stories told by scores of writers; but here is the story
of an Indian who led as fierce a gallop as that of the
courageous British squadrons at Balaklava, and it is
a tale which should live as long as that of any of the
other heroes of sabre, spur, and cuirass, whose names
adorn the most exciting pages of history. All honor to
Roman Nose, the intrepid leader of the Cheyennes,
whose mad gallop across the alkali wastes of the
Arikaree Valley in the spring of 1868 has had but little
recognition by writers of stirring deeds and desperate
attacks!</p>

<p>Two years before the conflict between the followers
of Roman Nose and the soldiers of the United States
Government, a council was held near Fort Ellsworth.
Kansas, between General Palmer and the head men of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>Cheyenne tribe of Indians. The conquest of the American
continent had begun. The steel rails of the Pacific
Railway were being laid across the hunting grounds
of the red men, and they, considering and believing the
ground to be their own, had come to protest against this
invasion of their soil.</p>

<p>As the General in command of the post listened to the
words of the chiefs, suddenly a noble-looking Indian
stood up and advanced in a solemn and majestic manner
to the centre of the chamber in which the council was
held. It was Roman Nose: one of the finest specimens
of the untamed savage. His physique was superb. A
large head, with strongly marked features, lighted by
a pair of fierce black eyes, a large mouth with thin
lips, through which gleamed rows of strong, white teeth;
a Roman nose, with delicate nostrils like those of a
thoroughbred race-horse, first attracted attention; while
a broad chest, with symmetrical limbs, on which the
muscles on the bronze of the skin stood out like twisted
wire, were some of the marked characteristics of this
splendid American savage. Clad in buckskin leggins
and moccasins, elaborately embroidered with beads
and feathers, with a single eagle feather in his scalp-lock,
and a rare robe of white buffalo, beautifully tanned
and as soft as cashmere, thrown over his shoulders&mdash;he
stood forth&mdash;the mighty war chief of the Cheyennes&mdash;and
said in measured tones:</p>

<p>"We will not have the wagons which make a noise
(steam engines) in the hunting grounds of the buffalo.
If the palefaces come farther into our land, there will be
scalps of your brethren in the wigwams of the Cheyennes.
I have spoken."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>
<p>But, in spite of what the noble-looking chieftain had
said, the white settlers continued to push into the
sacred precincts of the Cheyennes, to take up homes
there, and to treat the red men as if they had neither
right nor title to the soil. The Indians were soon upon
the warpath. Under Roman Nose and Black Kettle,
they swept through western Kansas like a whirlwind of
vindictive ferocity. They fought the gangs of workmen
engaged in the duty of laying the rails for the hated
Kansas Pacific Railroad; attacked the isolated homesteads
of the adventurous squatters; ruthlessly slaughtered
men, women and children, and ran off cattle,
sheep, and horses. From June to December, 1868, they
murdered one hundred and fifty-four white settlers and
freighters; captured between thirty and forty women
and children; burned and sacked twenty-four farmhouses;
and attacked several stagecoaches and wagon
trains. Great excitement existed along the border
settlements of Kansas and Colorado. Appeals were
made to the authorities of the general government to
give protection against the terrible Cheyennes, or else
allow the people to take matters into their own hands
and revenge themselves against their hereditary enemies.
General Sheridan, then in command of that military
department, was fully alive to the responsibilities of
his position, and, in his usual decisive manner, set
about the task of crippling the wild riders of the
plains.</p>

<p>In order to punish these bloodthirsty Cheyennes, the
celebrated Sheridan had not the necessary number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>troops. Congress, however, had authorized the employment
of detachments of frontier scouts to be recruited
from the daring spirits always to be met with
upon the border. So the General was only too ready
to listen to the request of one of his young officers,
Major George A. Forsyth, who asked him to grant him
permission to raise a body of scouts, independent of the
regular army. After listening quietly to what Forsyth
had to say, Sheridan remarked:</p>

<p>"I have determined to organize a scouting party of
fifty men from among the frontiersmen living here on
the border. There is no law that will permit me to
enlist them, and I can only employ them as scouts
through the quartermaster's department. I will offer
them a dollar a day, and thirty-five cents a day for the
use of their horses, which will, I think, bring good material.
Of course, the government will equip them,
and they will draw soldier's rations. If you care for
the command, you can have it, and I will give you
Lieutenant Fred Beecher, of the Third Infantry, for your
second in command."</p>

<p>"Thank you, General," was Forsyth's answer. "I
accept the command with pleasure."</p>

<p>"I thought you would," said Sheridan, smiling.
"And yet I hesitated to offer it. Understand if I had
anything better, you should have it."</p>

<p>"I am glad to get this," was the reply of the gallant
Major.</p>

<p>There was little difficulty in obtaining capable men
for the new command. There were hundreds of Civil
War veterans upon the frontier, while many a plainsman
was only too ready to have an opportunity of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
even with the wild riders of the West. In fact, men
had to be turned away, so eagerly did recruits flock to
the standard of the Original Rough Rider. In two days,
Forsyth&mdash;who had been with Sheridan in his famous
ride from Winchester to Cedar Creek&mdash;had enrolled
thirty men at Fort Harker. Sixty miles westward was
Fort Hayes, where twenty more were obtained two
days later, so that in five days from the time that
Forsyth had been given the command, he was marching
into the Indian country at the head of as brave a body
of plainsmen as ever swung a rifle across their shoulders.
They were looking for trouble, and they found it.</p>

<p>Roman Nose and his Cheyennes were known to be
somewhere near the Republican River, northwest of
Fort Hayes, and, as the little troop scouted northwards,
there were frequent indications of large camps of Indians
which had been abandoned only a few days before
the arrival of the command. On the morning of September
10th., a small war party of savages attacked
a train near Sheridan, a tiny railroad town some eighty
miles beyond Fort Wallace, another fort where Forsyth
had stopped to rest his men. They had killed two
teamsters and had run off a few cattle.</p>

<p>Immediately Forsyth's Rough Riders were upon the
trail of these Indians, and followed it until darkness
put an end to all pursuit. Next morning the chase
was continued, the trail grew continually larger, and
finally developed into a broad, well-beaten road, leading
up the Arickaree fork of the Republican River. It
was evident that a large number of Indians was ahead,
but Forsyth had come out to fight, not to run away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
so he pressed hard after the retreating band. As darkness
fell on the evening of the eighth day from Fort
Wallace, the command was halted and went into camp
near a little sandy island in the river: a mere sandspit
of earth formed by the shallow stream as it divided and
then came together again about a hundred yards from
the place of parting. The water was only about eight
feet wide and two or three inches deep.</p>

<p>During the last three days of the march, game had
been very scarce, which convinced the soldiers that
the Indians, whose trail they were following, had scoured
the country with their hunting parties, and had driven
off every kind of wild animal. Provisions were getting
low. The day following would see the command
nearly out of supplies of all kinds. But Forsyth was
called "Sandy," because of his grit and nerve, and he
determined to push on after the redskins until he found
them, and to fight them even if he could not whip them,
in order that they might realize that the Government
was in earnest when it said that the marauders of the
peaceful settlements were to be punished.</p>

<p>The first flush of dawn was reddening the sky next
morning, when Forsyth, who was awake, suddenly
caught sight of something moving stealthily by upon
the horizon. At the same moment the sentry saw it,
and cocking their rifles, the two soldiers gazed intently
into the dim distance. Suddenly the soft thud of galloping
hoofs came to their ears, and, peering just above
the crest of rising ground between themselves and the
horizon, they caught sight of the waving feathers upon
the scalp-locks of three mounted warriors. In an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
their rifles spoke in unison, and with the cry of "Indians!
Turn out! Indians!" they ran back to the camp. In
a second it was in confusion. Men jumped to their
feet and seized their rifles, as with a loud shouting,
beating of Indian drums, and rattling of dried hides,
about a dozen redskins galloped down upon the camp in
the apparent endeavor to stampede the horses. Crack!
crack! sounded the well-aimed rifles of the scouts, and,
as the Indians sheered off, carrying with them three of
the pack mules, one of their number dropped to the
turf.</p>

<p>"Saddle up! Saddle up, quickly, men!" was the
next order, and, in a very few moments, the horses were
saddled and bridled, while every man stood ready to
mount. Daylight had begun to appear by now, so that
one could see objects within a few hundred yards; when
suddenly an old-time scout, who stood next to Forsyth,
put his hand upon his shoulder, and cried: "Oh, heavens,
General! Look at the Indians!"</p>

<p>Forsyth's heart sank to his boots as his eye followed
the direction of the scout's outstretched hand. For
the ground seemed literally to sprout Indians. They
apparently jumped from the sod itself, and over the
rolling hills, out of the thickets, from the bed of the
stream, along the opposite bank, and out of the long
grass upon every side, hundreds of redskins&mdash;with shrill
cries of vindictive hatred&mdash;rushed down upon the fifty
scouts, standing immobile at their horses' heads.
"Fire!" shouted Forsyth, when a few of the red men
came quite close, and, as the sharp crack of the rifles
spat at the yelping braves, several ponies went down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
The Indians fell back, out of range, and a few moments
were given to the cool-headed United States officer to
perfect plans for a retreat.</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation he shouted his orders:
"Lead your horses to the little island. Form a circle
fronting outwards! Throw yourselves upon the ground
and intrench yourselves as rapidly as you can!"</p>

<p>No sooner had he ceased speaking than, in almost a
solid mass, the scouts retreated to the island, keeping
up a vigorous fusillade upon the surrounding Indians.
On the left, down the stream, a way to escape lay open
through the little gorge up which the command had
marched, but Forsyth knew enough of Indian tactics to
realize that the savages would line these bluffs with
warriors. Once upon the island, and they would have
to attack over open ground. Intrenched in this position,
the soldiers had an even chance of standing off this
overwhelming mass of Indians, who, realizing that they
had the white men in their power, rode around the
brave little army with yells of derision, and shot at them
repeatedly as they broke into a run in order to get to
the chosen position. A steady and galling fire poured
in upon the scouts from the reeds and long grass. Horses
fell to the earth on all sides. One man was killed,
several were badly wounded. Enfuriated at their
blunder in not seizing the island before the whites had
a chance to reach it, the various chiefs rode rapidly
around, just out of rifle range, and yelled to their
dismounted warriors to close in on all sides. The
steady crack of rifles sounded everywhere; the horses
reared and plunged at their tethers; men cursed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
groaned; the Indians howled savagely, and above the
frightful mêlée could be heard the calm commands of
Forsyth:</p>

<p>"Steady, men! Steady, now! Aim low. Don't throw
away a shot!"</p>

<p>At this thrilling moment, and as the men with tin-cups,
pocketknives, and tin dishes, were shovelling up
enough of the gravelly soil to form a rude protection, one
of the plainsmen shouted:</p>

<p>"Don't let's stay here and be shot down like dogs!
Will any man try for the opposite bank with me?"</p>

<p>"I will," cried out a man upon the other side of the
circle.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, men. It's your only chance!"
called Forsyth, as he stood in the centre of the command,
revolver in hand. "I'll shoot down any man who attempts
to leave the island."</p>

<p>"And so will I," shouted McCall, the first sergeant.</p>

<p>"Get down to your work, men! Don't shoot unless
you can see something to hit. Don't throw away your
ammunition, for your lives may depend on how we
husband it!" again cried Forsyth. And, as there was
a temporary lull in the fight&mdash;many Indians having
fallen to the rear of their line, badly wounded&mdash;the
scouts grew cool and determined, vigorously dug into
the sand with their knives and plates, and soon had a
good-sized barricade thrown up. Indian women and
children now covered the bluffs back of the valley, on
the north side of the stream, and their shouts and
wailing showed that many a redskin warrior had been
sent to the Happy Hunting Grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile one stalwart warrior of magnificent
physique and noble countenance carefully watched
the circle of scouts from a hillock down the winding
course of the Arickaree. It was Roman Nose&mdash;head
chief of the Cheyennes&mdash;his face painted in alternate
lines of red and black; his body naked, save for a red
scarf about his waist; his head crowned with a magnificent
war bonnet, from which, just above the temples
and curving slightly forward, stood up two short, black
buffalo horns. A long tail of eagles' feathers and herons'
plumes waved gracefully from the back of his head,
while a beautiful chestnut pony, held by a single deer
thong, pawed the earth beneath the supple frame of the
chieftain.</p>

<p>For days this intelligent war chief had seen and
watched Forsyth's scouts as they followed the trail of
his warriors. A few miles beyond, he had prepared an
ambuscade for them, so, if they had not camped where
they were, they would all have been undoubtedly
annihilated. There were Northern Cheyennes, Oglala
and Brulé Sioux, a few Arapahoes, and a number of
dog, or renegade soldiers composing this savage army.
In all there were almost one thousand warriors, accompanied
by their squaws and children, who were eager to
see the annihilation of the white men and the triumph
of their brothers, husbands, and fathers. Just think
of it! One thousand to fifty, and those fifty without
food, without horses, and hemmed in upon a tiny island
which could be easily reached, across only a few inches
of water! But such a fifty had not been seen since the
time of the Greeks who held the pass at Thermopylae.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Listen, and hear how they made one of the most desperate
stands of history!</p>

<p>Roman Nose was furious with anger, because he had
told his men to occupy the island, and they had not
done so. But he was confident that he could soon
crush the white men, even as members of his tribe had
annihilated Fetterman's command, a few years before,
near Fort Phil Kearney, in Wyoming. Summoning
his leading chiefs to him, he pointed out to them the
proper position to place the warriors in, so as to get the
best possible line of fire upon the entrenched camp;
and, explaining to them that, while a number of them
kept the whites at bay, fully five hundred should assemble
around the bend in the river and prepare for a
cavalry charge, he himself trotted his horse down the
bed of the stream, well beyond the view of the defenders
of the little island.</p>

<p>The clear atmosphere of a bright September day
gave just the proper light for accurate rifle fire. A
steady rain of bullets fell against the sides of the little
mounds which the Rough Riders of '68 had erected,
but the scouts only returned the shots when they saw
an opportunity to effectively use their cartridges.
Many a badly wounded brave could be seen crawling
over the plain to a place of safety, while the wails and
shrieks of the women on the bluffs sounded harshly
discordant above the rattle of small arms. The horses
were groaning in the agonies of death, and, as the last
animal fell to the ground, one of the savages cried out
in English: "There goes the last horse anyhow!"
which proved that some white renegade was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
ranks of the Sioux, Arapahoes, and Cheyennes. Forsyth,
who had been walking about among his men
giving directions and commands, now lay down behind
a gravel mound, and, as he did so, a shot hit him in the
fore part of the thigh, and ranging upward, made it impossible
for him to stand upon his feet. "Are you
alive!" shouted several of the men, knowing that he was
dangerously injured. "Yes, I'm all right," called out
their commander cheerfully, but, as he spoke, the fire
from several Indians who had crawled up upon the lower
end of the island made him lie down close to the gravelly
soil. Three of the plainsmen saw the flash of one of the
rifles from the centre of a little bush, and, taking accurate
aim, sent a bullet crashing into the skull of the Indian
brave. A wild, half-smothered shriek welled up from
the sagebrush, showing that another redskin had gone
to the land of the hereafter.</p>

<p>But Forsyth was now struck again, the bullet shattering
his leg bone about midway between the knee and
the ankle. A few moments later he rashly exposed
his head, and one of the Sioux riflemen immediately
drew a bead upon it and sent a bullet through the top
of his soft felt hat, which fortunately had a high crown,
so it glanced off, ripped through the skin of his head and
fractured his skull. In spite of these grievous wounds,
the brave soldier kept both his nerve and his courage,
and, seizing a rifle, took a shot at some Indians who
dashed up on horseback within rifle range. The Doctor,
who had been closely watching them, took a quick shot
at the foremost, and, as he dropped from his pony's
back, cried out: "That rascally redskin will not trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
us again." Immediately afterwards a dull thud told
Forsyth that someone near by had been hit, and,
turning around, he saw the Doctor fall upon the
sand, saying: "I'm done for this time." A bullet
had entered his forehead just above the eye, and the
wound was a mortal one. He never spoke another
rational word, and lingered for three days before
dying.</p>

<p>At this moment, trotting up the bed of the river, appeared
the wild cavalry of Roman Nose, five hundred
in all, and in about eight ranks of sixty front, extended
order. Before them all, upon a magnificent chestnut
horse, rode Roman Nose himself; his Springfield rifle
grasped in his right hand, and naked, save for his war-bonnet,
silken scarf, moccasins and cartridge belt. A
bugle rang out from somewhere in their midst, a bugle
which had been either captured or stolen from the
whites, and which some renegade, or half-breed, knew
how to use; and to the shrilling note of this instrument,
the savage horde came on.</p>

<p>From the hair of the Indians fluttered eagle feathers
and plumes of the white herons, which are sometimes
seen along the rivers of the great West. Their faces
were painted black, with red and yellow stripes running
horizontally. They were naked, save for moccasins and
cartridge belts; while each held a rifle in his hand, and
had a tomahawk and knife stuck into his belt, for close,
hand-to-hand work. Their ponies were of every color,
shade, and description, but were fat and in good condition,
for the bunch grass was plentiful in the country
watered by the branches of the Republican. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
had lariats of buffalo thongs wound around them,
while each was held by a single strand looped around the
under lip. Roman Nose was about five paces in front
of the centre of the line, while slightly in advance of
the left of the oncoming column was the medicine man,
an equally brave, but older chieftain. Savage cries of
encouragement sounded from the bluffs, where the
women and children were standing by thousands, to
watch the annihilation of the whites, and, as they
echoed across the rolling prairie, Roman Nose waved
his hand to them assuringly. Then turning towards the
breastworks upon the island, he shook his clinched
fist in savage defiance at the enemies of his country,
and raising himself to his full height, struck the palm
of his hand across his mouth as he uttered a wild, piercing
battle cry. Each warrior answered it; even those lying
in ambush near the river's edge took up the blood-curdling
slogan.</p>

<p>When Wellington saw Ney's cuirassiers debouching
from the huts upon the hill of La Belle Alliance, he gave
the order to form in hollow squares, and said: "Reserve
your fire until you can do damage, and make every
shot count. Never give in to the cavalry, lads. What
will they think of this in England?" With cool, Anglo-Saxon
courage the men of the North met the furious
charge of the soldiers of France without wincing. Eight
attacks failed to break the devoted squares at Waterloo.
It was this that saved the day for England and her
allies. Here, thousands of miles away, were men of the
same birth and breeding as those who stemmed the
onslaught upon the plateau of Mount St. Jean, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
although they were to be charged by enemies that
outnumbered them tenfold, they prepared for the fray
with the same bulldog determination which actuated
the redcoats at Waterloo. "The Indians are going to
charge us," called out Lieutenant Beecher. "You are
right," was Forsyth's reply. "Let the men get ready.
Six shots in each rifle magazine, and one in the barrel.
Have the revolvers loaded and ready, and never, under
any circumstances, fire at the Indians until I give the
word of command! We can break their line. Of that
I am certain. Only steady, men, steady, and do not
waste a single shot!"</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, the gallant leader propped
himself up in his rifle pit, placed his rifle and revolver
before him, and calmly waited for the onrush of the
followers of Roman Nose. And with a wild, earsplitting
yell they came on. A withering fire poured in from the
redskins in ambush, so that, for eight or ten seconds it
fairly rained bullets. Then came a sudden lull, as the
gallant five hundred thundered up the ravine towards
the defenders of the island. They came nearer, nearer.
Now they were within a hundred yards, and the expressions
on their painted faces could be plainly seen.
It was the time for action,&mdash;a moment which Forsyth
fully realized.</p>

<p>Sitting up in his rifle pit as well as he was able, and
leaning backwards upon his elbows, the grim and determined
officer shouted, "Now!"</p>

<p>Instantly the scouts scrambled to their knees, with
their rifles at their shoulders. Each man looked carefully
along the barrel of his piece, and then a ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
volley sounded above the wild yelping of the painted
followers of Roman Nose: the courageous.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>On came the red warriors, screeching like a pack of
timber wolves in the season of greatest hunger.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>In the centre of the line, a dozen ponies went down.
Their riders fell headlong upon the turf, but the rest
did not falter. The Indians were now but sixty yards
from the breastworks.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>The ponies seemed to be falling over one another. In
heaps, both redskins and horses lurched headlong into
the clear waters of the Arickaree. Shrieks, groans, and
savage yelping were mingled with the shrill wails of the
women and children who were witness to this, one of
the most glorious charges in history.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>Great gaps began to show in the ranks, as the Indians
came within fifty yards of the island of death. On
the extreme left the medicine man reeled on his pony's
back and fell headlong into the stream, while his followers
galloped madly over his prostrate form. Roman
Nose, with a loud yell of defiance, swung his Springfield
rifle over his head, as he galloped furiously to the edge
of the island. He reached the very end of it, when</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>The courageous Indian leader&mdash;the Custer of the
Cheyennes&mdash;staggered and reeled. He toppled over.
He went down amidst the thunder of unshod hoofs,
and prostrate upon the sand he lay, while his intrepid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
warriors leaped their foaming horses across his bleeding
form. But on, on, they came, while the cool-headed
plainsmen took careful and deliberate aim.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>The Indians were now galloping upon the firm soil
of the island. They were within twenty yards of their
enemies. They began to stagger. They hesitated.
They faltered.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>The seventh volley of lead swept through their broken
ranks, and, throwing themselves upon the off side of
their horses, with horrible cries of disappointed rage, the
great wave of painted warriors broke, divided, and
scattered in every direction. With a ringing cheer,
the scouts jumped to their feet, and, seizing their revolvers,
poured volley after volley into the retreating
and demoralized ranks of the running foe. The great
charge of Roman Nose was over; the impetuous warrior
lay dead upon the field of battle; and his wild, naked
followers, crazed with anger and disappointment, collected
in groups, just out of rifle range, and shook their
fists vindictively at Forsyth's devoted band; who, again
sinking to their rifle pits, made haste to load for the attack
which they knew would shortly come. The charge
of the five hundred had been as futile as the wild gallop
of the six hundred British hussars at Balaklava.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This was not all of the battle, but it was all of Roman
Nose. Twice again the Indians attempted to charge
the island, but they were easily driven away. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
scouts, meanwhile, had crawled through their lines from
Forsyth's command, had successfully escaped the
watchful eyes of the Indians, and carried news of the
desperate situation to the United States troops at Fort
Wallace, Kansas, some hundred miles away. Colonel
Carpenter, with seventy men of the Tenth Cavalry,
seventeen scouts, and an ambulance, immediately
marched to the rescue of the gallant Rough Riders. On
the morning of the ninth day of the siege of the island,
one of the weary men on watch suddenly sprang to his
feet, shouting:</p>

<p>"There are moving men on the hills." Everyone
who was strong enough, and not sufficiently starved out
from eating mule and horse meat, jumped up in an
instant.</p>

<p>"By Heavens! There's an ambulance!" cried Grover,
the oldest scout. The Rough Riders of '68 were rescued
at last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Carpenter's men were looking for the besieged
command of Sandy Forsyth, one of the troopers noticed
something white in a small valley through which he
was scouting. Calling one of his companions to him,
they galloped up to it, and found it to be a beautiful
wigwam made of freshly tanned, white buffalo skins.
As one of them entered, he saw, upon a brush heap, a
human figure, wrapped in buffalo robes. Stripping off
the covering, his eyes fell upon the body of a splendid
specimen of Indian manhood. Over six feet in height,
the savage had a stern and royal look, a majestic brow, a
firm and placid mouth, a magnificently modelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
torso, and limbs like whipcord. Rich garments had
clothed him, and heavily ornamented weapons were
carefully placed near by. In his breast was a deep,
gaping wound from a bullet which had pierced his
heart.</p>

<p>"It is Roman Nose," said one of the scouts. "See
the face. It is that of a hero."</p>

<p>On the return from the rescue of Forsyth, the men
stopped at the lonely tepee in the valley. The arms
and equipment were appropriated, as the legitimate
spoils of war, but the famed war chief was allowed to
sleep on undisturbed. With a regard for his great
bravery, the frontiersmen did not move the body of
the courageous warrior from its bed of boughs. Thus,
alone, unguarded, and unwatched, the remains of the
invincible Cheyenne were left to the vultures and
lurking gray wolves: the scavengers of the wide, untouched
and illimitable plains.</p>

<h2>GERONIMO: THE TERRIBLE APACHE</h2>


<p>At the inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt,
March 4, 1905, an aged Indian chieftain
rode in the procession, clothed in rich and gaudy
attire. As he passed by the reviewing stand, I watched
the expression upon his face. It was stolid, imperturbable,
sad, and as he looked up at the figure of the
Chief Executive of the all-conquering Anglo-Saxons,
he did not deign to give him a nod of salutation. With
a scowl upon his countenance, he rode up the broad
avenue, while the people gazed at him in some amazement.
It was the renowned Geronimo: the bloodthirsty
Apache chief.</p>

<p>This warrior had fought in many a desperate encounter
with the whites of Arizona and New Mexico, and, because
of his strength of body and ability to live in a
country in which his pursuers could scarcely exist, it
was many years before he was eventually captured.
Physically he was somewhat "squatty," but with a
tremendous girth of chest. His muscles were as hard
as bone, so hard that he could light a match upon the
bottom of his feet. His wants were few, and he cared
for no luxuries. War was his business, his life, and
victory was his dream. He would gladly travel hundreds
of miles to attack a Mexican camp, or an isolated
village. He would incur every risk to run off a herd
of cattle, mules, or sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>
<p>Geronimo, in his native wilds, wore no clothing save
a narrow piece of calico, or buckskin, about his loins,
a headdress also of buckskin, crested with the plumage
of the wild turkey and eagle, and long-legged moccasins,
held at the waist by a string, and turned up at the toes
by a shield which protected him from stones and from
the "cholla" cactus. If he felt thirsty when on the
warpath, he knew where to find the tiny springs and
brooks of the arid wastes, or, if he could find no water,
he would put a stone or twig in his mouth in order to
induce a flow of saliva. With this as a stimulus, he
would journey onward for hours.</p>

<p>This crafty warrior would pitch his bivouac by nightfall
at some distance from any spring, where his pursuers
would be least likely to look for him. Generally
it would be upon the side of some rocky mountain, along
which no trail would be left, and up which no pursuing
band of United States cavalrymen could ascend without
making so much noise that they would wake him long
before they were near enough to do any damage. He
was familiar with every ravine, cavern, cañon, defile,
gorge, and place which was inaccessible to horses. When
on a raid, his followers often lived upon rats, mice,
rabbits, and coyotes, and, if very hard pressed, killed and
ate the horses which they were mounted upon. No wonder
that they held out against the white men for months
after any other Indian tribe would have been annihilated.</p>

<p>As the whites took up ranches and settlements in
Arizona and New Mexico, there was continuous difficulty
with the Apaches. Various causes led to a final
outbreak, and, much as one may regret the fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
actions of some United States officers who were on the
frontier were mainly the reason for Indian hostility.
The Apaches soon instituted a reign of terror in the
Southwest, and there seemed to be no cruelty too
atrocious for them to commit. They made sudden
and daring raids upon the scattered ranch houses,
burning them to the ground, killing the inmates, and
carrying off the sheep, cows, and horses.</p>

<p>One day a ranchman of New Mexico was returning
from a distant search for a stray heifer, when, upon
mounting a hill just beyond his ranch house, he saw
flames issuing from the roof and windows of his home.
Putting spurs to his horse, he galloped up to the front
yard, anxiously looking for signs of his family. As he
did so, a wild yell came to his ears, and gazing across
the plain, he saw a band of four Apaches, with his little
son in their arms. Waving their hands at him defiantly,
they soon disappeared beyond the sloping
hillocks, while he, terrified and horrified at this unlooked-for
assault, hastened to the garrison of United
States troops, ten miles away, to warn them of the raid
and ask assistance. Not long afterwards a squad of
cavalry was in hot pursuit of the redskins, guided by
the heartbroken parent, who urged his horse at top
speed in the endeavor to overtake the marauders. But
knowing that pursuit was almost certain, the Apaches
had rested their ponies, and, as they were fresher and
tougher than those upon the trail, they soon left the
latter far behind. Plunging into a shallow river, they
wheeled about, and, while one held the little boy in
his outstretched arms to let the heartbroken father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
know that they still had him, the other shouted defiantly
at the United States soldiers. Then, turning
suddenly, they were soon lost in the mountains.</p>

<p>This was but one of many such raids, so when General
Crook took command of the United States troops of
Arizona, in June, 1871, the settlers of the border country
were in a frenzy of delight. At once this skillful
Indian fighter enrolled a number of friendly savages
as scouts. They were under a chief named Miguel,
who was perfectly familiar with the mountain haunts
of the Apaches, and, like bloodhounds upon the trail
of criminals, were perfectly able to hunt down the
followers of Geronimo to their last resort. In December
the American troops gathered in the Tonto Basin, a
mountain plateau surrounded by high ridges of the
Mogollen, the Mazatal and the Sierra Ancha ranges,
heavily timbered slopes deep with the winter's snow.
For the first time since they had been striving against
the whites, the Apaches found themselves matched in
their own game. The allied scouts of Crook's army
were as keen, as daring, and as untiring as the followers
of Geronimo, and piloted the men in blue uniforms to
the very heart of the bad lands, where was the lair of
these enemies of the border.</p>

<p>Splitting into small detachments, the United States
soldiers scoured the barren wastes in search of their
human quarry. The Apaches skulked, like mountain
lions, in the crevasses and coulies of the hills, and, seeing
that they were being surrounded, concentrated in their
strongholds, three of which were almost impregnable.
These were the fortress at the summit of Turret Butte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
the cliffs of the Superstition Mountains, and the cave in
the cañon of Salt River.</p>

<p>Major Brown's command was near the latter place
on December 28, 1872, when one of the friendly scouts
came up to the officer, saying:</p>

<p>"Heap 'Pache down below in cave. I show you
there, if your men follow. I live there once, but now
heart bad against Geronimo."</p>

<p>"My men will follow any trail you lead them on,"
said the United States officer. "We will be ready to
fight any band of Apaches in Arizona in fifteen minutes.
Lead us to the fort."</p>

<p>The soldiers welcomed the news of a near-by fight
with a cheer, for they were tired of perpetual marching
with no enemy in view, and, starting from their bivouac
in a small box cañon at the first appearance of a certain
star in the East, they pushed onward through the night.
At daybreak they were at the cañon of the Salt River,
where, in a cave halfway down the face of a vertical
cliff, the Apaches were in hiding. The trail leading to
this stronghold was narrow and dangerous, so narrow
in fact, that, should the Indians have discovered the
presence of the whites before they reached some rocky
hills, they could have annihilated the command. "Men,
will you follow me?" asked the gallant Major, at this
juncture. "We will," came from every throat. "Then
look to your carbines and ammunition," continued
Brown. "Put some crackers, bacon, and coffee in your
blankets slung over your shoulders; fill your canteens
with water; give a look at your moccasins, and follow
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>The friendly scouts gathered about little fires, and
stuffed themselves full of mule meat, while the soldiers
were picketing the horses and mules. Then their
medicine men walked before them, telling them what
to do, how to shoot, and how to creep upon the enemy.
This ceremony was soon over, and, as the bright light
of the guiding star began to twinkle in the East, the
soldiers and slinking redskins softly began the descent
to the cave of the Apaches.</p>

<p>Moving like a long file of spectres, the band of attackers
crept down the sides of the barren mountain.
For an hour or more the progress was leisurely. The
air was chill and blew keenly through the scraggy
cedars, which, like ghostly sentinels, nodded and beckoned
in the wind. At the crest of each hill the column
halted for a few moments, when a warning "<i>Tzit!
Tzit!</i>" hissed from the rear, signalled that the last man
had reached his place in line. Thus the black army of
death approached the sleeping followers of Geronimo.</p>

<p>Midnight had come, and all was silence. The sharp
yelp of a coyote sounded far off across the barren waste,
and Nantje (the head Indian scout) turned, seizing
Major Brown firmly about the body. "Quiet," he
whispered. "We have discovered a footprint in the
soil!" All were still, as the keen-eyed scout lay down
upon the trail with some comrades by his side, and,
with their blankets over their heads so that not the
slightest gleam could escape, struck a few matches and
inspected the sign. "Ugh! Ugh!" growled Nantje.
"It is a big bear's foot. He has been here but an hour
past. It is good luck for us, for when a bear crosses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the path of a war party, they will meet the enemy and
will be successful!"</p>

<p>Moving onward again for three or four hours, suddenly
the warning, "<i>Tzit! Tzit!</i>" sounded from the advance
guard. "Ponies!" whispered the scouts, and there in
a small, grassy glade were fifteen Pima ponies, which
had been driven up the mountain by Apache raiders
that very night. "See," cried Nantje, "the sweat is
not yet dry upon their flanks. Their knees are full of
cactus thorns, against which they have been driven
during the night. The Apaches have done this."</p>

<p>"Carefully, now," whispered Major Brown. "Advance
with great caution, and make no noise. We are
within rifle shot of the enemy."</p>

<p>Although there was no moon, the stars gave out
sufficient light to show that the soldiers were in a country
filled with huge rocks, behind which a well-armed
foe could fight for hours. In front was a deep valley:
dark, precipitous, vague. "You are at the place," said
Nantje. "A dozen picked men must be sent forward
with me to climb down the precipice in order to attack."</p>

<p>"All right," whispered the Major. "Fifty more will
come behind you. A strong detachment will hold the
edge of the precipice to prevent any of the hostiles
from getting above and killing our people with their
rifles. As soon as these first detachments secure the
field, the rest of our force will come down."</p>

<p>The Indians in the cave below were absolutely unaware
of the approach of the soldiers. They were in
high good humor, and were dancing to keep themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>warm. Several of the raiders who had just returned
from a trip of killing and robbing in the settlements
near Florence, on the Gila River, were bending
over a fire, and stirring some deer meat in a bubbling
pot, while a few sleepy squaws were cutting faggots.
Sheltered in the bosom of these grim precipices, they
fancied themselves secure from any intrusion save that
of the eagle, the hawk, the turkey buzzard, or the mountain
sheep. The fire danced upwards, sending the
fitful gleam of the flame over the rugged precipices of
inky blackness; while far below the glowing current
of the rushing Salado sounded like solemn music of an
invisible orchestra. But, hark, as the first glint of dawn
reddened the horizon, a call sounded forth, and its echoes
woke the stillness of the grim solitude: "We have you
surrounded. You cannot escape. Surrender!"</p>

<p>Taken aback at this unlooked-for demand, the Apaches
scattered, like slinking wolves, into the cave. They
then hurled back their savage defiance in their own
tongue. "We will die first. Not one of your own party
will escape from the cañon!" The death wail came
from the fortress, and then, out of the cave and over the
great pile of rock, which protected the entrance, swarmed
the warriors. Although outnumbered three to one, they
fought like tigers. The bullets rained down upon the
rocks like hailstones, and, striking the roof and mouth
of the cave, glanced along and wounded a number of
the women and children. Sharp wails of pain and rage
rent the air as the battle continued.</p>

<p>Again the Apaches were summoned to surrender, or,
if they would not do so, to allow such of their women and
children as they desired pass out between the lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
But to this demand came yells of defiance. A little boy,
not more than four years old, now ran out of the cave
and stood dumbfounded at the affray. Without a
moment's pause, Nantje rushed forward, grasped the
trembling infant by the arm, and escaped to the lines of
the troopers with the boy unhurt. A bullet struck the
little Apache, but did not injure him, and, as the new
recruit reached a place of safety, the troopers gave a yell
of encouragement and appreciation of the brave rescue.</p>

<p>The end of the fight had nearly come. A detachment
left by Major Brown at the top of the precipice to protect
the retreat, in case of necessity, had worked its
way over to a high shelf of rock, overlooking the cave
of the Apaches, and began to tumble down great boulders,
which speedily crushed the greater number of
these rude warriors of the mountains. The rifle fire
grew hot and savage; so savage that, in twenty minutes,
every Indian was dead at his post, and the troops
swarmed into the little fort. In the inner recesses of
the cave were the women and children, a number of
whom had been struck by glancing bullets and fragments
of rock. They were seized, carried to the pack
train, mounted on horses and mules, and started for the
nearest railway station. The great fight in the mountains
was over.</p>

<p>This was a crushing blow to the savages. Driven to
bay in their chosen fortress, where they thought that no
one could reach them, all of the warriors had been
exterminated, while only one white soldier had been
killed. As Major Randall, two days later, delivered
another crushing blow to the hostiles, at Turret Butte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the remaining Apaches, including Geronimo, soon
capitulated to the governmental forces. But this
snakelike warrior was not to remain long in peace and
quiet, for he resented the control of the whites. In
May he escaped from Fort Apache, taking with him
thirty-four warriors, eight boys, and ninety-one women,
who travelled one hundred and twenty miles before
camping. Thus and thus only they eluded the cavalry
sent in pursuit, and, although chased hundreds of miles,
the band safely reached the wild wastes of the Sierra
Madre Mountains.</p>

<p>General Crook pushed hot upon the trail of the
terrible Apache. The thermometer registered one
hundred and twenty degrees, and often more. The
air was like a fiery furnace, and the soil was like a hot
stove, under the feet of the troopers. Often the metal
work upon their guns became so hot that it could not be
touched with the bare hand, and sometimes, aflame with
thirst, they would reach a tiny spring&mdash;the only one for
miles&mdash;to find it befouled by the retreating Apaches, so
that neither man nor beast could drink from it. Still
Crook persisted and finally captured the crafty Geronimo.
He held him for only one night, and then the slippery
Apache escaped to the arid wasteland, leaving his wife
behind him in the hands of the soldiers. Several nights
later he stole into camp with four of his warriors, found
his wife's tent in the blackness, and, before the dozing
sentries discovered him, was off again into the wilderness,
with his better half strapped before him on his
scraggly pony.</p>

<p>Geronimo retreated into Mexico and lost himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
the treeless mountains which seemed to be incapable
of sustaining human life. But he was pursued by the
American troops as if he were a wild animal. Fortunately,
a treaty with Mexico made it possible for United
States forces to venture far beyond the Rio Grande,
and thus several detachments were soon upon the trail
of the outlawed Apache. Captain H. W. Lawton and
Assistant Surgeon Leonard Wood did their utmost to
capture him. He was hunted from mountain range to
mountain range; through snowfields, cactus plants, and
sun-baked ridges. Every device known to the red men
was practiced to throw the pursuing enemies off the
trail, but the half-breed trailers were good, and it was
soon evident that not a spot could be reached by Geronimo's
band which would offer them security. Twenty-five
different commands, or detachments, representing
four regiments, kept up this persistent trailing through
narrow paths, along dangerous divides, down side cuts
into the middle of precipices hundreds of feet high, up
precipitous banks and beetling crags; sometimes leading
the jaded horses for hours, at times looking vertically
into cañons whose bottom was a mile below. One of
the scouts, while looking for signs of the fugitives, rode
one horse nearly five hundred miles in less than seven
days and nights; while a young lieutenant once climbed
a mountainous ascent for twenty-six hours, with the
heat at 110°, and without water for eighteen hours of
this time. Such perseverance was bound to tell.</p>

<p>At length Lawton's troopers, clinging to the trail like
bloodhounds, and suffering much from heat and thirst,
cornered Geronimo's men in a valley three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
miles south of the Mexican boundary line, in the Sonora
range of mountains. There had been several skirmishes
with them along the way, and the United States troopers
had shown great gallantry under fire, especially in
rescuing their own wounded troops when under close
range of the rifles of Geronimo's Apaches. The food
supply of these fugitives was now exhausted, and,
realizing that to stand out longer would be the height
of absurdity, the Indians made signs of peace. At the
risk of his life, a young lieutenant, named Gatewood,
of the Sixth Cavalry, went unattended into Geronimo's
camp, and meeting the Apache chieftain face to face,
gave him the terms of speedy surrender. The old chief
was helpless, and he knew it. So he surrendered and
was brought back to New Mexico with the remnants of
his once powerful army of mountain fighters.</p>

<p>Upon his capture and return to the United States, a
tremendous call went up from the settlers of the Southwest
to have him removed to some place from which
he could not escape. "We do not know when this
terrible raider will not again break out and renew his
plundering and murder," wrote a committee of the
settlers to the Department of the Interior. And thus,
in deference to the wishes of the white pioneers, Geronimo
and the few people of his tribe, who had survived
the war, were sent to Florida, and then to Alabama,
to be confined upon a reservation. Geronimo, the
famous fighter, died in 1909, treasuring no doubt to the
last, happy memories of the time when, as a mountain
outlaw, he was the scourge and terror of the Southwestern
frontier.</p>

<h2>RED CLOUD: THE SIOUX VON SEYDLITZ</h2>


<p>A stalwart warrior of the Sioux nation was
lying before his tepee, busily sharpening his
hatchet upon a stone, when a cloud of dust
upon the horizon warned him of the approach of a
rider. He looked up languidly, as a calico pony approached
at breakneck speed, and, when a half-naked
warrior threw himself upon the ground and advanced
to speak with him, he scarcely deigned to notice the
visitor.</p>

<p>"Mahapiya-luta," said the dismounted warrior, "I
have news for you. Great news."</p>

<p>"Ugh," said he with the hatchet. "Let us have it,
Soboya."</p>

<p>"The palefaces are upon the waters which sound with
the music of bells. There are many of them with
horses with long ears, and boxes which run on wheels.
They are cutting down the pine trees and are building a
big house. The squaws of the paleface warriors are with
them, and the pappooses. They have iron pieces on
wheels which speak with the voice of thunder, and
instruments which, when placed to their mouths, sound
forth in tones of sweetness. Yea, they are many and
they are in the heart of our best hunting grounds."</p>

</div>



<p>Mahapiya-luta had leaped from the turf, as the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>was speaking, and in his eyes shone a fierce and sinister
lustre.</p>

<p>"How many are there?" he asked.</p>

<p>The courier looked puzzled for an instant, and then
held up both hands with a sweeping motion.</p>

<p>"There are as many as ponies in yonder herd," said
he. "The palefaces are as thick as trees along the side
of the mountain behind our camp. But we are greater
by ten times. Yes, we can sweep them off the face of
our land."</p>

<p>"And we will," shouted Mahapiya-luta, who was
known to the whites as Red Cloud. "Did I not tell the
Great White Eagle (General Carrington) so, in the
council at the house, called Laramie by the palefaces?
Did I not say that if he and his Long Swords stole the
country of our fathers without asking my permission
that we would take their scalps? Did I not tell him
that the fireboat which walks on mountains (locomotive)
could not come into our hunting grounds and scare off
all the game? Show me the place where the palefaces
have camped, O Soboya, and we will drive them from
the soil."</p>

<p>"Come with me," answered Soboya, "and you can
see for yourself that what I say to you is the truth."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On a plateau between two branches of the Piney
Creek&mdash;a branch of the Powder River in Wyoming&mdash;a
camp and stockade had been established, on the thirteenth
of July, 1866. Four miles away was the magnificent
Big Horn Range of Mountains, with a towering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
snow peak, called Cloud Peak, jutting nine thousand
feet into the azure sky. It was a lonely place&mdash;the
farthest post of United States regulars in the wilderness&mdash;but
as General Carrington, its commander, looked
about him upon the wide plateau decked with beautiful
flowers, and green with waving grass, he smiled
grimly at the scene of natural beauty. The mountains
and hills were covered with pines of restful green, the
waters of the creek and its tributary rivulets were as
pure as crystal. Trout leaped in the tiny pools and
cataracts. Antelope grazed upon the wide sweep of
the plains, while deep-rutted trails showed where the
bison had recently passed by. "It is a glorious situation,"
said Carrington to himself, "but the Indians
will not let us enjoy it as we should. Well, they will
find us ready and prepared. I, for one, am glad to be
here."</p>

<p>As the soldiers fell to work to erect the stockade and
buildings of this new fortification, called Fort Phil
Kearney, they were not long in realizing that the redskins
did not intend to leave them alone. Picket posts
were established upon the surrounding hills, which
overlooked the Bozeman trail and approaches from
both the East and the West. Three times they were
attacked by the hostiles. Upon the third of these, a
warrior in warpaint and feathers rode far out beyond
his yelping followers, and, shaking his clenched fist at
the soldiers who were bringing up a howitzer, called out:</p>

<p>"Red Cloud has told you to leave the hunting grounds
of the Sioux. If you remain here, you will all be killed.
Red Cloud has spoken."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>A jeer of derision greeted this insult, and a case-shot
was immediately exploded among the clusters of red
men. They scattered like chaff before the wind. The
soldiers cheered their departure, and, turning towards
the fort, withdrew in close order, with their faces towards
the evil-looking adherents of the Sioux chieftain.</p>

<p>This was not the last attack upon General Carrington's
frontiersmen, by any means, for many who ventured
from the fort were ambuscaded. The wood trains
which went out to fetch logs from a saw mill, some miles
away, were constantly attacked. There was fighting
all the time. Many stragglers who had ventured out
alone were cut off and killed. A few were scalped,
and crawling back to the stockade, were rescued by their
now terrified companions, who were constantly warned
not to leave the protection of the log fortress. From
the first of August, until the close of the year, the Indians
killed one hundred and fifty-four persons, wounded
twenty more, and captured nearly seven hundred
horses, mules, and cattle. Every train which passed
over the Bozeman trail was attacked, and there were
fifty-one demonstrations against the fort by Red Cloud
and his followers. Men grew used to war and the
sound of spitting bullets and flying arrows.</p>

<p>Among the officers of the fort was a Captain Fetterman,
who had had less experience in the country than
the other officers, and who was always anxious for a
fight. On the twenty-first of December a wood train
was sent out to gather a supply of timber for the fort,
and, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the lookout on a
hill near-by signalled that it had been attacked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Indians in force, about a mile and a half from the fort.
A relief party of eighty-one men was immediately sent
out to the aid of the beleagured whites, and the command
was entrusted to Fetterman. He boasted that
with this troop he could ride through the entire Sioux
nation.</p>

<p>As the soldiers left the post, General Carrington gave
specific orders that they were not to pursue the Indians
across a trail which was visible from the fort. "You
shall relieve the wood train, drive back the Indians, but
on no account pursue them beyond the Lodge Trail
Ridge," said the careful commander at the moment of
departure, and in a loud voice. "All right," called
Fetterman, "I shall be sure to obey your orders."
With a smile on his face, he rode out into the open,
taking a direction which would lead him to the rear
of the Indians who were menacing the wood train.</p>

<p>Red Cloud was in command of the savage horde upon
the plains, and, when he heard that Fetterman's command
was approaching, he directed his braves to retreat
down the valley. The wood train immediately
broke corral, and, as the redskins went away, made for
the fort. Fetterman and his men rode after the red
men, and, entirely disregarding the orders from General
Carrington, followed the fleeing braves down a ravine.
This was exactly what Red Cloud had wished, and,
taunting the oncoming soldiers with jeers and insults,
he had soon drawn them into an ambuscade. Suddenly
the bluecoats found themselves surrounded. Too late
they turned about to retreat to the protection of Fort
Phil Kearney. In their rear a vast and overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
mass of Indians galloped upon them, driving them into
a circle for defense, and shooting them down by scores.
The whites fought gamely and well, but it was of little
avail. They were soon overwhelmed by the great
numbers of the Sioux, as well armed as they were themselves,
and led by Red Cloud in person. Soon not a
single soldier was alive, and the air resounded with the
wild warwhoops of the victorious savages.</p>

<p>At the fort the heavy firing of the battle was heard
about twelve o'clock. Carrington instantly dispatched
fifty-four men to the relief of Fetterman and his doomed
command, who had disappeared from view behind the
sloping hills. The men went forward on the run.
Carrington, himself, mounted the observatory tower,
fieldglasses in hand, and anxiously scanned the distant
hills. He was fearful of the result of the expedition, but
dared say nothing to his officers and men, or to the women
and children who had husbands and fathers in Fetterman's
detachment. Late in the afternoon the relief
party returned with terrible tidings of an awful disaster.</p>

<p>When they had reached the end of the ridge nearest
the fort, they saw evidences of a great battle. Forty-nine
men were lying behind a pile of rocks, in a space
only about six feet square. They had been killed by
arrows and spears, and not by bullets. Fetterman was
found prostrate behind a hillock with another officer
by his side. As their heads were burned and filled with
powder around the wounds, it was evident that they
had committed suicide when they found that it was all
up with them. On every side were signs of the fiercest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
kind of hand-to-hand fighting. Behind a pile of stones
were two civilians who had been armed with modern
six-shot rifles, and as many Indian ponies lay near by, it
was evident that they had put up a stout defense.
Ghastly and mutilated remains, shot full of arrows and
stripped naked, were on every side. Red Cloud and his
braves had had a terrible victory.</p>

<p>By this defeat and slaughter of Fetterman's command,
Red Cloud gained so much fame that he was chosen to
be the leading war chief of the Sioux. Thousands of
painted warriors enrolled themselves with his band, and
he soon found himself in control of numbers of daring
spirits who were constantly on the lookout for another
battle with the Government troops. Travel on the
Bozeman trail was given up entirely. Letters from
the soldiers which got through the prowling Indians to
the East often had in them the words: "We are in
constant fear of our lives. This may be my last letter.
The Indians fairly swarm about the fort." Men of
the garrison who had moved West for adventure's
sake had found all that could satisfy the most delicate
palate. Danger was always present.</p>

<p>As winter passed and the warm breath of summer
blew across the prairie, Red Cloud was persuaded by
his warlike followers to make another attack upon the
whites. The painted braves were weary of cutting off
stragglers and attacking stagecoaches; they wanted
another stand-up fight. Half of the Sioux were armed
with rifles which they had obtained from white traders,
and some had repeaters. There were about three
thousand of these red warriors, and they were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
cowards, although they had a healthy respect for the
white troops. Under cover of frequent skirmishes,
Red Cloud collected his adherents within striking distance
of the fort, and by the first of August he was
prepared to have a desperate encounter with those who
had dared to trespass upon the land of his fathers.</p>

<p>Woodcutting was still going on in the vicinity of this
stockade in the far wilderness, and, under the leadership
of Major James Powell, numerous soldiers protected
those engaged in this task. The wagons used by the
woodcutters were furnished by the quartermaster's
department. In order to afford as much protection as
possible to their occupants in case of an onslaught by
the Sioux, loopholes were cut in the sides. Major
Powell had fourteen of such vehicles, and he drew them
up in the form of an oval, as the men busied themselves
in cutting down the neighboring forest trees. The
wheels were removed from all but two, which were
placed at either end of the barricade. It was thus a
formidable obstacle to an Indian attack.</p>

<p>On August the second Indians were seen approaching
the fort in great numbers. Red Cloud had made his
plan of attack, and had decided to annihilate the little
detachment under Major Powell (twenty-eight in all)
before he set upon Fort Phil Kearney. Although his
warriors dashed forward with extreme speed, they were
seen long before they reached the wagon-box corral.
On they galloped&mdash;three thousand of them&mdash;and, as
they appeared above the rolling hills, the sun glistened
upon their shining rifle barrels and painted faces. Chanting
a wild war song, and brandishing spears and rifles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
aloft, they came down upon Powell's little force like an
overwhelming wave of the sea. Yelping with savage
delight at the thought of an easy victory, they sent forward
a party of two hundred red men to stampede the
mules which were used in the wagons. The herders
stood them off for some time, but, seeing that it was
useless to fight against such odds, retreated towards
Powell's corral. Immediately a large force of painted
braves hastened to cut them off.</p>

<p>But Powell dashed out from the wagon boxes to their
rescue. With him were only fifteen men, but they
shot so accurately into the mass of Indians that the redskins
turned to drive them away. The herders, meanwhile,
made their escape towards the fort, and, after
a stiff brush with another detachment of Red Cloud's
army, managed to reach the safety of the log stockade.
Powell retreated to his wagon boxes, and there, with his
paltry twenty-eight, prepared for the onslaught of Red
Cloud's three thousand. There were greater odds here
than when Roman Nose charged upon the defenders of
Beecher's Island, and the whites were to distinguish
themselves as splendidly as did the Rough Riders of
"Sandy" Forsyth.</p>

<p>"Lie down!" shouted Powell to his men. "Throw
blankets over the tops of the wagons to screen yourselves!
Bore loopholes through the sides of the wagons with the
augurs, if you need more room to fight. And, for your
lives, don't fire until the savages are close upon us!"
So saying, he stationed himself at the end of the corral,
rifle in hand, and awaited the onslaught of the painted
followers of Red Cloud. As he ceased speaking, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
civilians and one old frontiersman, a dead shot, succeeded
in joining his party. Thus the numbers were
increased to thirty-two.</p>

<p>Powell was seven miles from the fort, and the chances
were that he would be relieved. This gave him some
satisfaction, as he saw Red Cloud busily giving directions
to his warriors, and massing them for a charge
upon the corral. The redskins were determined to ride
clean over the soldiers and end the battle with one, swift
blow. Remembering their success with Fetterman, they
doubtless felt that the fate of the thirty-two would be
the same. Their women and children were with them,
and, massed upon a number of hills, eagerly watched
their relatives as they formed in line of battle. Five
hundred Sioux warriors, magnificently mounted, suddenly
detached themselves from the three thousand,
and, urging on their multi-colored steeds with blows
and wild cheers, started head-on for the corral.</p>

<p>On, on, they charged. Slowly went the ponies at
first, but gradually their speed was increased, until they
were galloping with great swiftness upon the silent
wagon boxes. A cloud of alkali dust surrounded the
yelling band, while, in their rear, Red Cloud gathered
together his main force to rush into any opening which
the five hundred might make. They went on, on, on,
until it seemed as if they would be right among the
wagons, when, with a deafening roar, a frightful and
overwhelming fire was poured into their very faces. A
rain of bullets ploughed into the mass of redskins. Ponies
rolled over each other in great confusion. Painted
warriors fell headlong upon the turf. All were mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
together in a wild and tangled mass of maddened
bronchos and screaming Sioux.</p>

<p>As each of Powell's men had several rifles, the fire
from the wagon boxes was steady, persistent, and continuous.
Checked, but not halted, the redskins rode
up to the very edge of the corral and shot over the tops
of the wagons at the garrison. But not one leaped into
the enclosure. Dividing like a great billow of the sea,
what was left of the five hundred swept around the
hollow oval in a vain endeavor to find an opening.
But, as they rushed onward in a mad and desperate
gallop, a withering fire was directed into their very
backs, so that many fell helpless to the ground within
striking distance of the sides of the wagon boxes. So
close were the Sioux that often one bullet from a frontiersman
would kill two redskins. The rifles of Powell's
men were hot from rapid use, and revolvers finished
the defense of the gallant thirty-two, as the Indians
rode back to their disgruntled companions.</p>

<p>Disgusted with the failure of this attack, Red Cloud
consulted with his chieftains, and determined upon
another method of procedure. Seven hundred Indians
were formed into a skirmish party, and were told to
creep as near the corral as they could and to pour a heavy
fire into the wagons. The rest&mdash;about two thousand
warriors&mdash;were gathered upon a hill and placed in several
long lines. They were to overwhelm the men under
Powell, and to deal with them as they had with Fetterman,&mdash;the
disobedient. Let us see how they fared.</p>

<p>After the skirmishers had poured a hot fire into the
silent wagon boxes, which literally tore the tops to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
pieces, the two thousand began a mad gallop towards
the corral. Again there was an awful silence, until they
reached a distance of ninety yards or so from the defenders
of the wooden oval. The thirty-two had been
reduced to twenty-eight, but their spirits had not
suffered. As the stalwart braves came onward in
splendid war bonnets and beaded war shirts, it was a
sight which would have made many a man quail.
Several had shields of buffalo hide upon their left
arms, which were brightly painted and decorated with
fantastic designs. Led by the nephew of Red Cloud,
they dashed forward in a wide semicircle, chanting
wild war songs, calling upon the Great Spirit to aid
them, and brandishing their weapons aloft. It was a
clear day. The sun shone brightly upon them, and
made good targets for the silent and watchful men
from Fort Phil Kearney.</p>

<p>They advanced in a wild, uneven column, when</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>A volley poured into their faces, knocking the nephew
of the great Red Cloud to the turf, and sending down
full twenty warriors among their plunging bronchos.
Still they came on, and</p>

<p><i>Crash! Crash!</i></p>

<p>A still more deadly mass of lead ploughed gaps in
the line. They did not falter, but swept forward with
fierce cries of anger and disdain. Ponies screamed in
agony and broke from the mass of maddened braves
whenever their riders fell prostrate to the turf. The
Sioux were now within twenty yards. It was a terribly
critical situation. Should they leap over the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
barrier, it would be all over with Powell's valiant band.
But</p>

<p><i>Crash! Crash! Crash!</i></p>

<p>The Sioux were so close that the troopers rose to their
knees, in their excitement, and threw their augurs, revolvers,
and knives into the faces of the Indians. It
was like the charge of Grover's brigade on Stonewall
Jackson's men behind the railroad cut at Second Bull
Run. The white men did anything to keep off the foe.
They were desperate.</p>

<p><i>Crash! Crash! Crash!</i></p>

<p>Others were keeping up the fire. The Indians wavered.
They broke. They began to ride away. A fierce cheer
rent the air from the brave twenty-eight, and, upon a
hillock a half mile away, Red Cloud, like Napoleon at
Waterloo, bitterly bewailed this sudden and appalling
reverse. He thought that he saw the end of his power
as head war chief of the bloodthirsty Sioux.</p>

<p>With desperation the Indians now formed for another
attack. The ground around the corral was literally
piled with heaps of the slain. In spite of this they
charged six times upon the defenders of the wagon-box
corral. For three hours there was continuous fighting
and stubborn resistance. Finally, as Red Cloud's
warriors apparently formed for a last, desperate onrush
a shell burst in the midst of the Indian skirmishers, and,
through the trees away off to the left, the gallant defenders
of the wooden fortification saw the blue uniforms
of approaching soldiers. They were saved!</p>

<p>Cheer upon cheer rent the air, as, at the head of one
hundred men, Major Smith galloped into view. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
herders, woodsmen, and scouts who had escaped from
their camps in the morning had reached the fort with
the news of Powell's danger. Thus, all who could be
spared from the stockade had been sent, with a howitzer,
to rescue the brave defenders of the wagon-box corral.
Red Cloud's warriors retreated in sullen silence, carrying
off their dead, as is their custom. Had they again
turned upon the whites, when they were in the open, there
is no doubt that they could have nearly annihilated
Smith's little body of rescuers, because of their overwhelming
numbers.</p>

<p>When Powell's rangers reached the protection of
Fort Phil Kearney, many were half crazy with the excitement
and nervous strain of the fight. Several never
completely recovered from the terrible experience
through which they had just passed, and Powell, himself,
was an invalid for three years. Never had white
men displayed greater hardihood, courage, and fighting
prowess against overwhelming masses of redskins; and
the fact that nearly half of the total Indian force were
either killed or dangerously wounded (as was afterwards
learned from Red Cloud himself) bears full witness to
the accurate marksmanship of the whites.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A treaty was made with all the Sioux within six
months, and Fort Phil Kearney was abandoned to its
fate. The troops were withdrawn. The followers of
Red Cloud immediately burned the wooden stockade
to the ground. Red Cloud, himself, never afterwards
participated in an important action with the soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
although elected to the position of head chief of the
Sioux. The prestige which he had lost at the wagon-box
fight returned after the abandonment of Fort Phil
Kearney, and he was always admired and respected by
his red followers. In the war of 1876, General Mackenzie
surprised his camp before he had an opportunity
to go upon the warpath, which, to say the least, was
most fortunate for those who wished to have peace upon
the frontier.</p>

<p>The Sioux leader lived to be nearly ninety years of
age, and, when questioned upon his feelings about the
defeat by Powell's men, would say: "It was a big
fight. The long swords fought as I had never seen them
before. My warriors were as thick as blades of grass.
I went in with many. I lost over half. The long
swords shot true to the mark. My warriors never
fought again."</p>

<h2>SITTING BULL AND CRAZY HORSE: GENERAL AND ABLE LIEUTENANT OF
THE GREAT SIOUX REBELLION</h2>


<p>A troop of United States cavalrymen wound, like
a great worm, up the dry bed of a tortuous
creek. It was in March, 1876, and the weather
was bitterly cold. Sharp, biting gusts blew the dry
alkali dust into the faces of the bronzed troopers. But
with determined manner they pressed on towards the
purling waters of the Powder River.</p>

<p>As the weather-beaten commander of this expedition
trotted quietly in the front of the line, a horseman
suddenly appeared upon the horizon, and, galloping
hard for the travel-stained column, drew rein before
the leading officer.</p>

<p>"General Reynolds," said he, "the village of Crazy
Horse is not more than five miles away. You must
approach with caution, but, as you outnumber them,
I feel sure that there can be but one outcome of the
fight."</p>

<p>The officer in command smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lieutenant," said he. "You have
scouted well. We will be all prepared for a brush
with my old friend Crazy Horse within an hour."</p>

<p>Then, turning about, he called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p>"Close column, men! Tighten saddlegirths, and
look to it that your ammunition is all ready. We are
about to have a warm affair."</p>

<p>As the men busied themselves with their arms and
accoutrements, a lean timber wolf sneaked from behind
a small bunch of cottonwood trees. Sitting on his
haunches, he howled dismally. It was the song of
death.</p>

<p>What did this alkali-covered column mean&mdash;there
upon the bleak, unpopulated Wyoming plains? Why
these grim-visaged warriors: these munitions of war:
these scouts and vigilant-eyed officers of the Government?
It meant that the last great Indian campaign
had begun; and that within the course of a year the
power of the native Americans would be irrevocably
broken. The country of the Sioux was encircled by
the forts and agencies of the white men. A railroad
now crossed the continent and ran through the land
of the elk and the buffalo. Surrounded by their civilized
enemies, the Indians determined to make one
last desperate stand against the whites.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull, an Unkpapa chief and medicine man,
was the real leader of the Sioux. His were the brains
which conceived and executed the movements of the
warriors. But Crazy Horse, an Oglala, was the true
leader in time of battle. Sitting Bull was the Grant,
and Crazy Horse the Sheridan, of the Sioux army.
One conceived and the other executed.</p>

<p>There was plenty of ammunition among the savages,
and they were as well armed as the soldiers. There
were still many buffalo in the country of the red men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
and of food and clothing they had abundance. Their
women and children were with them. Their ponies
were many. Their warriors numbered several thousand.
And, realizing that they were now encircled and enveloped
by their hated enemies, they determined to
make a last, desperate resistance to the power of the
Government, which had determined, late in 1876, that
thereafter all Indians in the Northwest must live upon
the reservations.</p>

<p>"God made me an Indian, but not a Reservation
Indian," Sitting Bull had said.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit has told me that I shall defeat
the whites," Crazy Horse had added.</p>

<p>Thus, stimulated with a just pride in their own strength
and resources, the Sioux retreated to the region of the
Big Horn mountains, determined to retain their independence,
and to drive off the whites. They were
patriots fighting for the soil which they had been born
upon. They fought gamely, desperately, mercilessly;
until beaten in detail by the superior ability of the
whites, they at last were forced to a peaceable life
upon the Government reservations.</p>

<p>General Reynolds soon found the Indians. Under
fire from a band of warriors upon the hills, his men
charged upon the camp of Crazy Horse and drove the
redskins to a high bluff. While shot at very heavily
by the warriors, the soldiers began to destroy the
tepees. The fire from the followers of Crazy Horse
grew more and more accurate. In spite of a stout
resistance by the troopers, the redskins began to push
them very hard. They soon had found the range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
the camp, and many of the cavalrymen went down
before their accurate aim. Suddenly Reynolds ordered
a retreat&mdash;so suddenly that the bodies of several of
his men were left behind to the fury of the Sioux, while
one wounded man, it is said, was abandoned to an
awful fate among the hostiles.</p>

<p>As is always the case when white men move back
before red, the followers of Crazy Horse grew more and
more bold as the whites withdrew. It was bitterly
cold&mdash;so cold that the soldiers suffered intensely from
the zero weather. Following the example of Crazy
Horse, the red men made a vigorous attack upon Reynolds'
force, and, by a bold and impetuous advance,
succeeded in recapturing seven hundred of their own
ponies which the troopers were driving before them.
After this they seemed to be satisfied with their actions,
and, apparently unmindful of the freezing temperature,
rode quietly and joyously back to their own camp. All
the honors were with Crazy Horse, and he was the hero
of the western plains.</p>

<p>What General Crook said when Reynolds returned
is not worthy of repetition, for he was the commanding
officer of this expedition against the Sioux and was
hastening to the assistance of that officer with his
infantry and wagons. It was a disgraceful affair from
the viewpoint of the Americans, but in the camp of
the Sioux there was dancing and song. "The Great
Spirit is upon our side," chanted the warriors. "We
shall drive the palefaces into the land of the setting
sun. We shall again sleep in peace upon the prairie."
But they could not read the signs aright.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>
<p>At Fort Fetterman, Wyoming, nine hundred cavalrymen
and three hundred infantry were soon in motion
against the Indians. Crook was in command of this,
the most efficient force which had ever been sent against
the Sioux. He was an officer of large experience, and
so, on May 29th., 1876, began the advance, before the
weather was too hot for campaigning. Past the ruins
of old Fort Phil Kearney marched the dusty column;
past the beetling cliffs of the mountains; the great
stretches of glorious prairie covered with variegated
wild flowers and the bleaching skulls of buffalo; on
through the deep defiles and coulies of the numerous
crystal streams which rippled through this glorious
plateau, until, on June 9th., the army encamped upon
the south side of the Tongue River. Here a message
was received from Crazy Horse, which said:</p>

<p>"If you cross my river, my warriors will take your
scalps. Go back into your own country and leave me
and my children alone."</p>

<p>But Crook had no intention of going back. Instead
of that, he remained where he was and laughed at the
threats of Crazy Horse: the vainglorious.</p>

<p>At half-past six the cry of "Indians! Indians!"
roused the weary troopers from their preparations.
<i>Crash! Crash!</i> came two rattling volleys, and from the
bluffs across the river arose the wild war whoops of
the followers of the great Sioux leader, who had begun
to make good his threat.</p>

<p>Springing to their feet, the soldiers immediately
formed in line of battle and replied to the shots of the
redskin braves. Imagining that the canvas tents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the white men were full of soldiers, the Sioux directed
their fire upon them, and the camp was swept with
bullets. Fortunately the troops had run out into the
open, and, forming in a long skirmish line, vigorously
replied to the fire of the warlike followers of Crazy
Horse. The mess chests in camp were split with bullets;
several horses were struck; the wagons were splintered
by the leaden balls; a few tent ropes were cut;
and the shelters toppled to the ground. "Cross the
river with your battalion and charge the enemy!"
shouted General Crook to Captain Mills, and, as the
troopers splashed through the water with bugles blaring
and pennons fluttering, he turned to a young lieutenant,
and said: "Now watch them retreat! Nothing can
stand this advance!"</p>

<p>With fierce war whoops the Indians greeted the charge
of the troopers, and, aiming at them, endeavored to
keep them away. They did not realize that the men
under Mills were old-time fighters, and, not at all
frightened at their rifle fire, charged upon them vigorously.
Meanwhile the long-range rifles of the other
troopers began to find them; so, waiting until the
whites had reached the very top of the bluffs, they
suddenly broke and fled. Few of their numbers had
been wounded, and they had not killed a single United
States soldier.</p>

<p>Leaving a portion of his men to guard the baggage
and wagons, Crook now pushed on after the retreating
Crazy Horse. In a few days he had reached a large,
rolling bit of prairie, surrounded by high bluffs, near
the Rosebud River. He camped here, while some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
his Crow and Shoshone Indian scouts went on a buffalo
hunt. Crazy Horse had his own scouts out watching
the movements of the oncoming column, and when
he saw them in such a favorable position for attack,
he, himself, began the battle. In this he showed a
confidence that few Indians had ever exhibited.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight upon a gloriously bright morning,
when rifle shots sounded from the bluffs over which
the Indian scouts had disappeared. A cloud of dust
soon arose upon the skyline, and galloping into camp
came a few of the Crow and Shoshone scouts. They
were yelping with fright.</p>

<p>"Sioux! Sioux! Heap Sioux!" they shouted. "They
are coming! Get ready!"</p>

<p>The bugle blared the call to arms, and immediately
the troopers fell in. They were none too soon, for,
suddenly, out on the plain before them came hundreds
of painted warriors. Crazy Horse had joined forces
with Sitting Bull. Their combined commands were
determined to crush Crook's column, as Red Cloud had
annihilated Fetterman. Gay with paint and war bonnets,
they streamed out upon the plain, yelling their
savage war songs, and firing their rifles at long range.
The feathers from their head-dresses floated out in
the wind; their war ponies were grotesquely painted;
their entire bodies were bright with brilliant buckskin
or yellow ochre. They circled around like blackbirds
upon a field of grain. Thousands seemed to be in
sight, and they were apparently little afraid of the
resolute-looking forces before them.</p>

<p>It did not take Crook long to give his orders. "Charge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
with your troop, in front," he shouted to Mills. "Van
Vliet, take your squadron to the rear and keep the
Indians from circling round us. To the left Royall and
Henry's battalion will charge. The infantry and part
of the Second cavalry will hold the centre!"</p>

<p>The fight was now on in earnest. Mills' troopers
struggled through a bog; raced across a long stretch of
prairie, and rushed up the bluffs upon which the Sioux
were riding around in a circular motion. They dashed
upon the Indians with revolvers drawn. Firing them
in the very faces of the red men, they nearly reached
the hostile line, when the Sioux broke and fled to a
second ridge. Charging them here was quick work
for the cavalrymen. But the savages would not stand
and galloped off to a safe distance. As the troopers
dismounted to form a skirmish line, the redskins circled
about them, kicking up clouds of alkali dust, yelping
like mad men, and firing at intervals. They only
wounded one or two of their assailants.</p>

<p>The soldiers under Royal, Henry and Van Vliet had
equal success in driving back the Sioux, until Henry
was severely injured by a bullet which struck him in
the face. The friendly Crows and Shoshones fell upon
the flanks of the followers of Crazy Horse, about this
time, but did little damage. The numbers of Sioux
seemed to increase every moment, and, when Henry
fell, they attacked with some spirit. Twice the redskins
galloped across his prostrate form, but luckily
he was not hit by the ponies' hoofs. His men rallied
and rushed to his rescue. There was fierce fighting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>over the body of the gallant cavalryman&mdash;such fighting
as at Cressy, Agincourt and Poitiers, when men
fought hand-to-hand. Clouds of dust arose from the
feet of the plunging horses; the air resounded with the
fierce wails of the Indians; while the <i>crack, crack</i> of
rifles spat their slogans of death above the tumult of
the fray. Mills was withdrawn to gallop down a cañon
in order to attack the village of Crazy Horse, and, as
his troopers disappeared, the Indians seemed to grow
less eager to advance. Gradually their rifle fire slackened;
they turned their ponies' heads towards their
village; and soon went off down the sides of a deep
cañon. For two hours this conflict had lasted, and the
honors had been about even.</p>

<p>When Mills dashed down the cañon with eight troops
of cavalry, he confidently expected to gallop into the
Indian village and annihilate what reserve Crazy Horse
had left behind him. His men moved rapidly and had
come within a short distance of the tepees, when firing
was heard in front.</p>

<p>"Halt!" shouted Mills. "Cinch up saddlegirths!
load revolvers, and see that your ammunition in your
guns is properly adjusted!"</p>

<p>No sooner had he halted than an aide came galloping
up from the rear.</p>

<p>"Mills," said Nickerson, the courier, "Royall has
been badly handled; there are many wounded. Henry
is severely hurt, and Vroom's troop is all cut up. The
General orders that you and Noyes defile by your left
flank out of the cañon and return, at once, to the field.
He cannot move out to support you and the rest, on
account of the wounded."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>
<p>"I will not obey," said Mills at first, so anxious was
he to reach the village; but, thinking better of his
resolution, he ordered his men to turn to the left and
defile out of the cañon. It was well that he had done
so, for just below was a great dam, covered with logs
and broken timber. It was a trap laid by Crazy Horse.
Here he had massed a great body of Indians, and had
the eight troops of cavalry advanced, they would have
been annihilated.</p>

<p>This ended the operations for the day. Crook camped
upon the battlefield. Ten of his soldiers had been
killed, and twenty-seven had been seriously wounded.
It is true that he had driven the followers of Crazy
Horse from the scene of conflict, but, as he himself
had exhausted all his ammunition and a larger part of
his supplies, he was forced to retreat to his base. Crazy
Horse had protected his own village, crippled his adversary,
and had withdrawn in peace and security. He
had stopped the further progress of the expedition and
had fought a drawn battle with one of the ablest of
Indian fighters. His reputation and prowess among his
own people was thus increased tenfold, and he was the
idol of his nation.</p>

<p>The great numbers of savages under Crazy Horse and
Sitting Bull soon camped further north in the valley
of the Little Big Horn. Here on June the 25th., 1876,
they were attacked by General Custer. In "Famous
Cavalry Leaders," I have fully described the great
fight which there took place, so it is useless to speak
further of this famous affair. Custer, and the greater
portion of his command, were annihilated. The Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
escaped towards the Northeast, and, eluding the vigilance
of Gibbon and Terry, were soon hastening towards the
Canadian border.</p>

<p>After the defeat of General Custer, the Government
realized that the Sioux war was a more serious affair
than they had at first considered. Reinforcements
were hurried into the country of the hostiles, and Crook
and Terry were ordered to press after the Sioux with
the utmost celerity. As Terry's forces were in bad
condition, and were soon withdrawn from the field,
Crook alone was left in active pursuit of the retreating
bands of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull. He chased
them through the burning solitudes of that vast Northern
wasteland like a veritable bloodhound. Through rain,
snow and drought his weary troopers kept after the
Indians. During the heated summer months there was
no forage for the horses, and the rations of the men
became wellnigh exhausted. The savages had swept
the country free of game. They, too, were suffering
from lack of subsistence, but their condition was never
as bad as that of the troopers under Crook.</p>

<p>On, on, went this indefatigable column; now subsisting
upon mule and horse meat; now thankful for
a few raw onions which grew in the hollows unbaked
by the blinding sun. Finally, when the supply of
rations was reduced to two and one-half days', Crook
realized that his men would all die of starvation if
forage and food were not at once secured. It was
either food, or death in the wilderness.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty of the best men, with the last
of the mules and the best horses, were formed into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
advance party under Captain Anson Mills, of the Third
Cavalry, and sent to Deadwood City in the Black Hills
to get provisions. They pushed on, little expecting to
see Indians. But at a place called Slim Buttes, in the
northwest corner of South Dakota, the scouts discovered
a large village of forty or fifty lodges of the Sioux,
pitched upon the banks of a small stream called Rabbit
Creek. American Horse&mdash;a prominent chief&mdash;was here
in command, and he was a good fighter. But Mills
determined to attack the camp at once and made his
dispositions with care.</p>

<p>The attack was a complete success, and the village
was taken with but little loss. Some of the Sioux were
killed and others were captured. Many escaped through
the ravines to a plateau surrounding the valley, and,
throwing up rifle pits, determined to sell their lives
dear rather than to surrender. Several took refuge
in a cave, and, when commanded to come out, replied
with jeers and taunts, saying: "Crazy Horse will soon
be here, and he will rescue us." American Horse was
with these warriors, and he fought like an ancient Greek.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>Mills promptly dispatched a courier to Crook, on the
fleetest horse in his command, to ask for reinforcements
at once. Then he vigorously assaulted the cave. The
little band inside sold their lives dearly, and even the
women used guns with good effect. But no one could
have stood up against the rain of bullets that was
showered into the cavern. American Horse surrendered,
and when Crazy Horse&mdash;with some six hundred warriors&mdash;came
galloping up to the ridge, where some of
his followers had hidden, he was too late. Crook had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>joined with Mills. Imagining that only a few men
were there before him, Crazy Horse charged upon the
troopers, yelling his war song with all the fervor that
had rung at the battles of the Rosebud and Little Big
Horn. He was greatly astonished at the numbers of
his antagonists, and, realizing his mistake, retired to
the tops of some tall buttes with the soldiers after him.</p>

<p>Now occurred one of the most picturesque battles
of the West. The Sioux were all around upon the
buttes and were silhouetted against the sky. Steadily
the soldiers advanced against them up the sides of the
cliff. They scaled it under fire and reached the level
plateau upon which Crazy Horse and his men were
scattered. With a loud cheer they charged the redskins
upon the run. The Sioux divided; fled; and left
the field and camp to the troopers. In their camp
were found many letters belonging to Custer's men
which had been sealed, ready for mailing, when they
had been annihilated at the Little Big Horn. There
were also books, saddles and equipment of the "Fighting
Seventh." Thus, that which had been lost came
back to the men of the army and brought many tearful
recollections of the gallant men who had been killed
with Custer.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull was in Montana and still unfriendly.
Troops were put in motion to bring him to terms,
under General Nelson A. Miles. It was the winter of
1876-7 and a severe one, but the soldiers had fur boots,
fur caps and clothing of the thickest texture. With
such provision they could easily move and fight in the
zero temperature of that northern land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>On October 18th., a wagon load of supplies from Glendive,
Montana, was attacked by the Sioux, and, after
the hostiles had been driven off, the troops who escorted
the train moved to a place called Clear Creek. The
Indians followed, and, during a lull in the hostilities, a
messenger rode out from their lines, waving a paper,
which he left upon a hill, stuck between two forks of
a stick. When it was picked up, it read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">

"<span class="smcap">Yellowstone.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I want to know what you are doing travelling on
this road. You scare all the buffalo away. I want to
hunt in this place. I want you to turn back from here.
If you don't, I'll fight you again. I want you to leave
what you have got here, and turn back from here.</p>

<p class="hivatkozas">
I am your friend,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Sitting Bull</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>I mean all the rations you have got and some powder.
Wish you would write me as soon as you can."</p></blockquote>

<p>Several days later General Miles, with nearly four
hundred troopers, overtook Sitting Bull on Clear Creek.
There were one thousand warriors with him of the
Miniconjous, San Arcs, Brulés and Unkpapas, together
with their wives and children. A meeting was arranged
with the old chief, but the wily Sioux refused
to come into the Reservation. He became engaged, as
he talked, and his manner seemed more that of a wild
beast than a human being. "He finally gave an exhibition
of wild frenzy. His face assumed a furious
expression. His jaws were tightly closed, his lips were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
compressed, and you could see his eyes glisten with
the fire of savage hatred."</p>

<p>A young warrior stole out of the Indian lines, as
the conversation progressed, and slipped a carbine
beneath his blanket. Several others followed him, and
gathered around Sitting Bull as if they meant treachery.
Miles, who had only a revolver, ordered these savages
to retire, and, obeying reluctantly, they withdrew.
Sitting Bull argued like a conqueror; he would not
come into the reservation; he wanted the troops to
leave the country. He spoke this way in two conferences,
and, seeing that nothing could be accomplished
by further parley, Miles told the chief to prepare for
fighting, for he intended to attack immediately&mdash;in
five minutes. Taking his watch in his hand, he counted
off the time; while the savages, shouting defiance,
galloped back to their own lines.</p>

<p>Suddenly, smoke ascended from the Indian camp.
The Sioux had fired the prairie grass. In the midst
of clouds of flame and smoke the troops pressed home
the attack upon the hostiles. Although Sitting Bull's
warriors far outnumbered the whites, they were driven
away from their camp. Under the leadership of Gall
and other warriors, they charged wildly upon the Government
troops. Sitting Bull&mdash;as at the Custer massacre&mdash;did
not appear upon the firing line, but remained
in the rear, giving directions. He was a better talker
than fighter and believed in allowing the young bloods
to do the actual campaigning. They fought hard, too,
and at one time pressed the whites so closely that&mdash;like
Wellington's men at Waterloo&mdash;they were forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
to form in hollow squares. The Indians were driven
for forty miles.</p>

<p>Seeing that they could do nothing with the troops,
many of the Sioux broke into small bands and scattered.
Two thousand of them, however, came in on the third
day and surrendered. Sitting Bull refused to think of
such a measure, and, making for the Canadian boundary
line, rode off into British territory. His depleted and
starving camp was subsequently attacked, in mid-winter,
by a detachment under Lieutenant Baldwin, and was
still further crippled. Game to the last, he threw himself
upon the protection of England, crossed the Canadian
line, and lived for some years in peaceful security.</p>

<p>At last, realizing that he would be better off in his
old hunting grounds, he returned to the United States
and surrendered to the army. A large territory was
assigned to the Sioux as a reservation, and an Indian
agency established at Pine Ridge, in South Dakota.
This place became the rallying point for the scattered
bands of Sioux who still looked to Sitting Bull for
counsel. Supported in idleness by the Government,
and occasionally exhibiting himself with Buffalo Bill's
"Wild West Show," the noted chief lived for some time
in great contentment. But within him slumbered a
deep dislike and distrust of the whites. He was one
of the prime movers of the Ghost Dance uprising in
1890, and, while resisting arrest, was killed by an Indian
policeman. Peace to the aged counsellor and sachem
of the Sioux!</p>

<p>Crazy Horse had still one more fight in him before
he, too, was forced to capitulate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>
<p>Late in December of 1876, Miles started after this
gallant fighter, who was supposed to be in the valley
of the Tongue River, south of the Yellowstone. He
found his village not far from the place where Crook
had battled on the Rosebud. There were between eight
and nine hundred warriors posted on the cliffs surrounding
a valley of the Wolf Mountains,&mdash;a spur of the Big
Horn Range. The position was a good one, because the
soldiers had to scale some bristling heights to get at the
savages, but they were equal to the emergency.</p>

<p>"You have had your last breakfast," shouted the
red warriors as the soldiers began to climb up to their
position. "You will not eat again." But they did
not know with whom they were dealing. Undaunted
by the superior position of the red men, and unfrightened
by their jeers, the soldiers crept up the face of the cliffs,
as the shells from their artillery exploded among the
followers of the gallant Crazy Horse. The bluffs were
icy and snow-covered. It was rough work to scale
them; it was only accomplished after slow, dogged,
determined crawling, with a halt every moment or so
to fire at some Indian above. The plunging shots of
the savages did little damage, for their aim was unsteady.
The red men clung to their post tenaciously,
but they were routed&mdash;driven off&mdash;and forced back upon
the plateau in the rear. Snow was now falling, and the
combatants fired at each other in a blinding blizzard.</p>

<p>This was the last stand of Crazy Horse and his band,
for their ammunition was about gone, and, not possessing
the knowledge necessary to manufacture more,
they were unable to prolong their resistance. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
confederates were nearly all captured. Sitting Bull was
miles away and could not be reached. The Brulé
Sioux and Unkpapas had surrendered. Their supplies
were in the hands of General Miles and his men. Their
fate was sealed.</p>

<p>In the early spring Crazy Horse surrendered, with
the remnant of his once formidable band of frontier
fighters. He was placed in a reservation of the Brulé
Sioux at the Red Cloud Agency. "He did not surrender
with the humility of a defeated, broken-spirited chief,"
Major-General Jesse W. Lee has written me. "He was
an unsubdued warrior; a great soldier chief; and had
come in to make such terms as would bring peace and
rest to his people, who had scarcely known defeat under
his valiant leadership. To his mind there was no <i>unconditional
surrender</i> about it. He was willing, for a
time, to give up the uncertain buffalo for the certain
Agency beef; to exchange the old, worn-out skin lodges
for new and handsome army duck."</p>

<p>But Crazy Horse chafed under the restraints of the
agency. He was restless, uneasy and unsatisfied with
the tame conditions which he found. He was watched
by detectives and was closely guarded, but one day
escaped and came to Spotted Tail: another rendezvous
of the Sioux, forty miles away. Trouble was feared
from him, and what subsequently occurred is best told
in the language of General Lee, who was there at the
time, in charge of the Brulé Sioux at Spotted Tail
Agency in Northwestern Nebraska. He says:</p>

<p>"We soon called the chiefs together and told them
that probably some trouble might occur at Red Cloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
but it must not affect them, and for all to remain perfectly
quiet and have no fear. We then had only to
wait! Imagine, if you please, being compelled to sit
down over a powder magazine, with sparks flying
around, and wondering how long it would be until the
blow-up comes. We felt certain an explosion <i>would</i>
occur, but uncertain as to the hurt it might do. Well,
we had not long to wait! About 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> <i>an Indian
courier arrived in the Northern camp</i>&mdash;<i>not to us!</i>&mdash;his
quivering horse all white with foam,&mdash;with the startling
news that their friends were fighting at Red Cloud, and
that the troops were coming to Spotted Tail Agency.</p>

<p>"The old scout, Joe Merivale, well known and respected
by the Northern Indians, had been sent to
their camp with some reliable Agency chiefs, to meet
just this contingency and allay excitement. By dint
of hard effort they were succeeding fairly well, when
Black Crow came to us and said, "<i>Crazy Horse is in the
Northern camp!</i>" This came like a clap of thunder
from a clear sky. Could it be possible, after all the
precautions, spies, detectives, and the large force of
troops and Indian allies, that the one man of all others
they wished to secure <i>had made good his escape and had
come to our Agency</i>?</p>

<p>"The arrival of the Indian courier from the Indians
had produced intense excitement, but when he was
soon followed by Crazy Horse, there was a wild scene,
beggaring description. The bold warrior, the venerated
hero of his band, who had ever led them to victory, was
in the midst of devoted friends, and to them a hunted
victim of rank injustice and cruel persecution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the tepees in that camp came down with magic
swiftness, and had it not been for White Thunder, and
other loyal Brulés, a stampede would have resulted
at once; merciless slaughter of unsuspecting whites on
the line of flight would probably have followed, and
another Indian war inaugurated.</p>

<p>"The 'reliables' surrounded and harangued the camp
and restored some degree of quiet. Word was sent to
the Indians under Touch the Clouds, to bring Crazy
Horse to the Post. Major Burke, Dr. Koerper and
myself, with an interpreter, started for the Northern
camp, about three miles from the Post. When over
half way out, we met over three hundred armed Indians
in good line of battle, not so much <i>guarding</i> as <i>escorting</i>
Crazy Horse, in the direction of the Post. There were
war bonnets and war shirts in profusion, and had it
not been for a score or more of 'reliables,' intermingled
with the three hundred, we might have had serious
trouble. Touch the Clouds was on one side of the
great warrior and the brave, handsome White Thunder
on the other, with the austere and desperate Black
Crow just in the rear. Just here I would add that
White Thunder and Black Crow had determined to
shoot Crazy Horse, should he make a break.</p>

<p>"We took Crazy Horse to the Post, or I would better
say, he and his three hundred friends were taking <i>us</i>
there. Just as we reached the little parade ground of
Camp Sheridan, Spotted Tail, able planner that he was,
arrived from another direction, with not less than three
hundred of his trusty Brulé soldiers, all armed with
good breech loaders, principally Winchesters. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
number, with more who joined soon after, gave good
solid backing, and, with our ninety soldiers at quarters,
ready to aid at a moment's notice,&mdash;turned the scale
and kept it safely in our favor. As if by intuition,
these forces of Indians formed on either side of a walk,
leaving a small space, about 6' × 8', in the center. It was
a wild, weird scene; and had the spectacle been for
display, it would have been grand beyond compare,
but, as it meant most serious business, and was fraught
with danger, every nerve was under the severest strain.
For once, Crazy Horse realized that his prestige had
forsaken him; for once he was in the presence of one
whose mastery he dare not, then and there, dispute.
Spotted Tail, the coolest man of all the assembled hundreds,
in the plain, Indian blanket garb, without any
insignia of chieftainship, stepped into the little arena,
and in a few words, delivered in a clear, ringing voice,
with dignity and eloquence, addressed Crazy Horse,
who was almost within touch: 'We never have trouble
here; the sky is clear; the air is still and free from dust!
You have come here and you must listen to me and
my people! <i>I</i> am chief here. We keep the peace.
We, the Brulés, do this! <i>They</i> obey me! and every
Indian who comes here must listen to me! You say
you want to come to this Agency and live peaceably.
If you stay here, you must listen to me. That is all!'</p>

<p>"It is hard to justly render an Indian speech, especially
on such an occasion; but had you heard its
telling points and pauses, emphasized and punctuated
by the click of loaded rifles, you would have thought it
one of the most effective speeches ever delivered. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
conclusion was greeted with four hundred vociferous
'hows.' One frenzied Northern Indian, believing his
friend Crazy Horse was to be harmed, wanted to sacrifice
himself in his place. He caught hold of Major Burke's
arm and excitedly exclaimed: 'Crazy Horse is brave,
but he feels too weak to die today. Kill me! Kill
me!' The Brulé guns were already loaded, and had a
shot been fired, serious trouble would have begun.</p>

<p>"After a few more words, and as night was coming
on, the crowds dispersed, and we got Crazy Horse
into Major Burke's quarters to have a talk. He seemed
like a frightened, trembling, wild animal, brought to
bay, hoping for confidence one moment and fearing
treachery the next. He had been under a severe
nervous strain all day, and it plainly showed.</p>

<p>"Before proceeding with what was the last talk or
council, let me go back a little. Soon after we heard
Crazy Horse had reached our Agency, a courier arrived
from Red Cloud with the following message from Clark:
'Dear Lee:&mdash;There has been no fight. Crazy Horse's
band is just going into camp and will give up their guns
without trouble, in all probability. Crazy Horse has
skipped out for your place. Have sent after him.
Should he reach your Agency, have "Spot" arrest him,
and I will give any Indian who does this, $200.' Soon
thereafter, a squad of fifteen or twenty Indian scouts
arrived from Red Cloud, having been sent after Crazy
Horse to arrest and take him back. It was understood
then, and afterwards known to be a fact, that they
overtook Crazy Horse as he was riding along quite
leisurely with his sick wife, and when they asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
him to go back with them, the prestige of his name
and warlike deeds overawed them when he said: '<i>I
am Crazy Horse. Don't touch me! I'm not running
away!</i>'</p>

<p>"At our talk in Major Burke's quarters, Crazy Horse
seemed to realize his helplessness. We assured him
we had no reason to do him any hurt; and he promised,
almost at the outset, to go with me next day to Camp
Robinson.</p>

<p>"The best solution of the matter was to get Crazy
Horse back to Red Cloud safely and quietly; let him
make his talk there with the authorities, who could
decide what should be done as to granting or refusing
his desire for transfer to our Agency. He said he wanted
to get away from trouble, that he had brought his sick
wife to be treated and came for that purpose only. I
told him I would remember what he said and repeat
his words to the authorities at Robinson. Several of
the chiefs were held responsible, under a binding Indian
pledge, for Crazy Horse's safe keeping during the night
and his reporting to Major Burke next morning at
nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"Crazy Horse reported at the appointed time next
morning and said he had changed his mind about
going back to Red Cloud, because he 'was afraid
something would happen.' He asked us to go down
without him and fix up the matter for him and his
people. We assured him we had no thought of harming
him in any way; that he owed it to his people at Red
Cloud to return, and we insisted upon his return peaceably
and quietly, to which he agreed upon the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
express conditions, which, under the circumstances,
Major Burke and I felt we had a perfect right to make:
first, that neither Crazy Horse nor myself should take
any arms; second, that I would state to the Soldier
Chief at Red Cloud all that had occurred at Spotted
Tail Agency, and that if Crazy Horse had made a statement
of the facts, I would say to the Soldier Chief that
Major Burke, Spotted Tail and I were willing to receive
him by transfer from Red Cloud, if the District Commander
so authorized; that Crazy Horse should make
his statement to the Soldier Chief as to what occurred,
how 'he had been misunderstood and misinterpreted;
that he wanted peace and quiet, and did not want any
trouble whatever.'</p>

<p>"We made Crazy Horse no promise that he would
be transferred to Spotted Tail Agency, because <i>we</i> knew
and <i>he</i> knew that could be settled only by the higher
authority at Red Cloud. Boiled down to a simple
statement, our promise to Crazy Horse was that he
should be <i>heard</i> on his own behalf, upon arrival at Red
Cloud. On this condition, he was willing to return
peaceably, and with Major Burke's express consent, <i>I
guaranteed its fulfillment</i>.</p>

<p>"Crazy Horse asked to ride horseback, which request
was granted. We started from the Northern camp
about 10.30 on the morning of September 5th. In the
ambulance with me were Louis Bordeau, the interpreter,
Black Crow and Swift Bear, two reliable Agency chiefs,
and High Bear and Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's
friends. By consent, seven Northern Indians went
along to see fair play, but Good Voice and Horned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
Antelope, two 'reliables,' rode with Crazy Horse, to
take care of him and prevent his escape.</p>

<p>"When about fifteen miles out, small parties of
Spotted Tail's Indian soldiers began to arrive, and
when half way, about twenty miles, I had over forty
reliable Indian soldiers. Crazy Horse then realized
that he was practically a prisoner.</p>

<p>"At one time, Crazy Horse dashed ahead and disappeared
for a moment over the brow of a hill one
hundred yards away. 'Twas here he probably obtained
a knife of an Indian family stampeding to Spotted
Tail. He was soon overhauled and said he went ahead
only to water his horse. He was then directed to ride
immediately in the rear of my ambulance, and he saw
at once he was closely guarded. He seemed nervous
and bewildered, and his serious expression showed
clearly he was doubtful of the outcome. He said but
little, but his appealing looks seemed to ask, 'Is this
treachery?' Ignorant of what was in store for him, I
tried to reassure his friends by telling them not to worry,
that I would do exactly as had been promised, present
his case, and he could be heard also.</p>

<p>"When within fifteen miles of Red Cloud, I sent a
note to Clark by a swift Indian courier, asking whether
I should take Crazy Horse to Post or Agency. I also
stated briefly and explicitly that we had to use tact
and discretion in securing Crazy Horse without precipitating
serious trouble, and that we had promised him
that he should be heard by the Commanding Officer, or
the 'Soldier Chief,' when we reached Red Cloud, and I
requested that arrangements be made accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p>"When within four miles of Red Cloud, I received
this answer, in writing: 'Dear Lee:&mdash;General Bradley
wishes you to drive direct to his office with Crazy
Horse. Yours, Clark.'</p>

<p>"I had built the post and knew that the C. O.'s office
was next the guard house. This brief note, being silent
as to the important parts of my request, signified to
my mind that Crazy Horse was to be put in the guard
house, but still I hoped that <i>he would be allowed to say
a few words</i>, at least, <i>which would redeem the promise we
had made in good faith</i>.</p>

<p>"We proceeded to the post, my Indians on either side
of the ambulance, with pieces ready for instant use, and
Crazy Horse in the center. Upon arriving at the C. O.'s
office, I was met by the Adjutant, who informed me
that General Bradley directed that Crazy Horse be
turned over to the officer of the day. I said: '<i>No,
not yet!</i>' and asked if Crazy Horse could say a few
words to the C. O. before this was done. I was referred
to the General. I had Crazy Horse dismount,
go into the office and sit down, and Swift Bear, Touch
the Clouds, High Bear, Black Crow and Good Voice
went in with him. I stationed an Indian soldier at
the door with orders to admit no one while I was away.
I then went to the General's quarters, some 200 yards
distant, and in earnest and respectful language preferred
my request, and he informed me, in no doubtful
terms, that ''twas no use! The orders were peremptory;
he could not change them; General Crook himself
could not change them, and nothing further need
be said, and the sooner I turned over Crazy Horse the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>better!' I tried to explain what had been done; just
what had been promised in securing Crazy Horse, to
all of which the General said: 'It's too late to have any
talk.' I replied: '<i>Can he be heard in the morning?</i>'
The General looked at me steadily for an instant, but
did not answer. I was again ordered to deliver Crazy
Horse to the officer of the day, and 'tell him to go
with the officer of the day and not a hair of his head
should be harmed."</p>

<p>"General Bradley was every inch a soldier. An
order to him was law and gospel and met with prompt,
undeviating obedience, and woe betide the one who
dared question, evade or fail in obeying <i>his orders</i>. I
knew the General too well to attempt to prolong the
interview. I felt that as it must be done, ''twere well
'twere quickly done,' yet, as I retraced my steps to
the office, I had a glimmering hope that on the <i>morrow</i>
Crazy Horse might be heard and the promise thus redeemed.
I told Crazy Horse '<i>the night was coming on</i>
and the Soldier Chief said it was too late for a talk;
that he said for him to go with the officer of the day
and he would be taken care of and not a hair of his
head would be harmed.'</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of my message, the chiefs uttered
a joyous 'how!' Crazy Horse's face lighted up hopefully,
and he stepped quickly across the room to the
door and took the officer of the day, Captain Kennington,
warmly by the hand. <i>My</i> duty, my <i>military</i> duty,
was done, but I took Touch the Clouds and High Bear,
Crazy Horse's friends, to one side to explain to them,
as best I could, the unexpected turn affairs had taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
and how it was I had nothing more to do with the
matter and that I was entirely subject to higher authorities
there.</p>

<p>"Crazy Horse willingly went along with Captain
Kennington, closely followed by two soldiers of the
guard with side arms, straight to the guard house
and into the main door. When he reached the prison
room, he saw the dungeon cells, the small grated window,
and some prisoners in irons, it was said. Across the
puzzled brain of this Indian leader, whose life had been
free as the wind, there no doubt flitted the terrible
thought of prison chains and ignominious death. He
was, then and there, at last brought face to face with
what the white man had in store for him. To his
mind, abandoned by his friends, alone, betrayed, and
surrounded by a score or more of his armed enemies,
he sprang, with the desperation of an infuriated tiger,
into the main guard room, and drawing from his clothing
a long, glittering knife, attempted to plunge it
into Captain Kennington, but the Captain's drawn
sword diverted this purpose; he then sprang outside,
striking right and left and struggling to make his way
to where his seven friends were.</p>

<p>"At this juncture, Little Big Man, an erstwhile
friend and comrade of Crazy Horse, appeared on the
scene. He seized Crazy Horse by the arm and attempted
to force him to the ground. The great chief,
even in his frenzy, was too magnanimous to plunge
the knife into the heart of Little Big Man, but merely
punctured his arm to free himself from his treacherous
grasp. He then tried hard to kill a soldier of the guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
who blocked his way. Swift Bear, Black Crow and
Fast Thunder caught him, and in the struggle Captain
Kennington called out: <i>'Kill him! Kill him!</i>' and just
then an Infantry soldier of the guard made a successful
lunge and Crazy Horse fell, mortally wounded, with a
deep bayonet thrust in his right side.</p>

<p>"The friendly Indians prevented Crazy Horse's
friends from firing on the guard. All the Indians were
taken by surprise, and upon the pressing appeal and
earnest demand of his friends, Crazy Horse was carried
into the office from whence he came.</p>

<p>"Confusion followed; troops turned out, and pandemonium
seemed to have broken loose in the Indian
camps. Even the friendlies, though they disliked
Crazy Horse, were not pleased with the result, and
there was not much that could then be explained to
their satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Crazy Horse's uncle at once sought to take revenge,
but two friendlies caught and led him away. Touch
the Clouds asked permission to take Crazy Horse to
an Indian lodge and let him die there, but it was refused.
He then asked to remain in the office with
him, and that was granted on condition that he give
up his gun. I recall his remarkable reply: '<i>You</i> are
many. <i>I</i> am only one. <i>You</i> may not trust <i>me</i>, but <i>I</i>
will trust <i>you</i>! You can <i>take</i> my gun!'</p>

<p>"Crazy Horse's old father and mother were also
allowed to remain with him. About 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Touch
the Clouds sent word that Crazy Horse wished to see
me before he died. I went to the office. Crazy Horse
was lying on the floor, as he desired. He took my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
proffered hand and said between his dying moans,
'My friend, I don't blame <i>you</i> for this; had I listened
to you, this trouble would not have happened to me.'
He died at midnight, and thus passed away the restless,
untamed spirit of as brave an Indian chief as ever
drew a bow or wore a moccasin.</p>

<p>"After his death I was informed, and the statement
is, I believe, in the official reports, that he had threatened
to kill General Crook, should the General scold or speak
roughly to him, at a proposed council to be held at
Crazy Horse's camp, some days prior to this trouble.
General Crook was on his way in an ambulance to
the camp for the talk, when one of the scouts, or some
one who was watching Crazy Horse, met him with
news of this impending danger, and the General returned
to the post without meeting Crazy Horse. This
<i>may</i> have all been true, but whether it was merely an
idle threat, announced in a spirit of bravado, or if
made and meant, he would have sought an excuse to
carry it into execution can never be known.</p>

<p>"A field officer of Cavalry, then a Captain, informed
me that his troop was detailed to take Crazy Horse
from the guard house that night at midnight and push
on rapidly to the railroad, and from there he was to
be sent as a prisoner to the Dry Tortugas.</p>

<p>"When he died, Touch the Clouds shook hands with
all present, thus showing he had no bad heart toward
anyone.</p>

<p>"Crazy Horse's father made some pathetic remarks
as to the life and character of his son. He asked that
he might take the body away and give it an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
burial, and consent was given&mdash;<i>the lifeless form was
harmless then!</i> The offer of an ambulance was declined,
and at daylight, September 6th., the gray, bareheaded,
wailing, wretched, old father and mother, followed on
foot out of the post the travois on which was lashed
the body of their only son and protector. Their pitiable
condition appealed to the sympathy of everyone, and
as they passed Major Burrowes' quarters, they were
kindly offered something to eat, which they accepted
with apparent gratitude, and then resumed their mournful
journey.</p>

<p>"With respect to Crazy Horse, I neither eulogize
nor condemn. I have merely stated the facts as they
occurred, mainly under my own observation, or as
told to me by reliable eye-witnesses. There is no Indian
journalist, author or reporter, to present the warlike
chief's side of the sad story of his tragic fate. With
the lapse of time, his name and fame may linger for
a while in the traditions of his tribe, and then fade
away forever."</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>Farewell to the Indian!</p>

<p>We have seen that, from the time of the very earliest
European adventurers, to the great Sioux uprising of
1876, there has been but one result of the contact
between the whites and those of another color. Powhatan,
the diplomat, was as unable to keep his land
from the Anglo-Saxon invader as was Sitting Bull, the
tactician. For nearly four centuries the gradual conquest
of the American continent went on apace, with
frightful carnage, suffering and race hatred. The most
fit survived; the people of lesser intelligence and thrift
had to give way to those of superior attainments.</p>

<p>It has been a picturesque struggle. There has been
the fierce battling against the Pamunkies of Virginia
and Opechancanough, the ruthless Virginian. There
has followed the strange warfare in the rude forests of
Massachusetts with King Philip, and the neighboring
contest with Sassacus, chief of the Pequots. Later,
was the sanguinary struggle in the Mohawk Valley of
New York; the wild fighting around the wooded slopes
of the Hudson; the swift marches and vainglorious
retreats in the dreamy forests near Lake George, and
by the banks of the gray, glittering Champlain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as the restless pioneers crept southward and
westward, was the carnage of Tippecanoe; the stalwart
campaigning in the trackless forest of the Illinois; the
battling in the land of Weatherford, the Creek conspirator;
and the long-continued campaign in the dark
and dismal gloom of the Florida Everglades. It was
a time which put men upon their mettle, and in which
no shirker or weakling could hope to have a place of
responsibility.</p>

<p>The most desperate struggles were between 1868 and
1876, struggles which have made heroes of both red
men and white. As the steel rails of the Union Pacific
road crept steadily but surely across the continent, the
Sioux and Cheyennes desperately endeavored to stem
the overwhelming influx of white settlers, who followed
in the wake of the army and the railroad. There was
fighting&mdash;and plenty of it&mdash;for Custer, Crook, Miles,
Forsyth and the other gallant officers of the United
States army. Such chiefs as Roman Nose, Crazy Horse,
Sitting Bull and Red Cloud fought with all the tenacity
and strength which they could command. It was of
no avail. The fields of the Rosebud; Beecher's Island;
the Little Big Horn; and Slim Buttes; mark stepping-stones
in the conquest of the continent by the white
invader.</p>

<p>I, myself, have trod over the ground on which Opechancanough
battled with the whites in Virginia; have
packed across the wide sweep of prairie in Wyoming
which once echoed with the wild shouts of the followers
of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull; have slept near the
crystal waters of the Powder River; and have camped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
where the cañons once echoed with the rifle shots of
Lieutenant Sibley, a gallant scout of Crook's command,
who was with him at the battle of the Rosebud. There
were no signs of the red man in this magnificent country.
He had vanished from the grassy plateaus and beetling
mountains, as had the game which once abounded in the
fertile land.</p>

<p>The Indian of the plains has disappeared. Now,
educated in the ways and customs of the whites, in
various schools for the members of his race, he joins
in the conquest of the soil, and in modern progress, by
the same methods adopted by those of superior mental
development. The gorgeous war bonnets, magnificent
trappings, and painted accoutrements have given way
to the sober dress and technical instruments of the
whites. The picturesqueness and color which surrounds
the native American will shortly fade away. Spirited
has been the history of his struggle for the land of his
forefathers, and sad has been its ending.</p>

<p>Farewell to the Indian of the plains!</p>
